Worm composting has been a fun experiment in our house, turning our food scraps back into __nutrient-dense compost__ that we can use in our garden and around our yard.

Our kids are much more comfortable with worms because of the experience having these guys living in the composter in our basement and we're excited to grow some amazing veggies in our garden using the compost.

Don't forget to get some [worms][worms] as well!
