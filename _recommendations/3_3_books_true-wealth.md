_"How and Why Millions of Americans Are Creating a Time-Rich, Ecologically Light, Small-Scale, High-Satisfaction Economy"_

A great book looking at how to live a rich life without that being governed by money and stuff.

Strong emphasis on the __sharing economy__, __self-provisioning__, and finding joy through community and connection. Filled with great data and research but also inspiring at the same time.
