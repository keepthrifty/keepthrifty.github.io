Quite simply, one of the more inspiring books I've read. This book helped me understand what drives me and what kind of __mark I want to make on the world__.

My why is (roughly): _"I believe that there's almost always a better way to do things and that putting the knowledge and systems to do things better in peoples' hands can help them live better lives"_
