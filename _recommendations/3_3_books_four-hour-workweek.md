_"Escape 9-5, Live Anywhere, and Join the New Rich"_

I first read this book in 2010 and I really love the "think outside the box" mentality that Tim Ferris advocates.

Being willing to __live differently__ than those around you and __experimenting in your life__ are two big concepts that started us down the path that we're on now.
