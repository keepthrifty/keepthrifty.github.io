Thrifty is the way we __track our spending and income__ so we can get a top-to-bottom picture of our finances.

Because Thrifty forces us to manually enter in each expense, we've become much more aware of where our money is going and the act of knowing we're going to have to log each expense has actually prevented us from spending on some things we really didn't need.

Best of all, Thrifty is __free__.
