Le Parfait jars are what we use for most of our __bulk food__ purchases.

Bea Johnson at [Zero Waste Home][zero-waste-home] has been an inspiration, showing how mindful consumption can significantly reduce the waste you create.

Beyond this, Bea's approach has allowed her and her family to have less wasteful spending since she's no longer paying for packaging for the goods she purchases.

Eco-friendly and thrifty all bundled together :)
