## Life Flipping (Coaching)

Some people like to flip houses - taking a building that has lots of promise and bringing it to it's full potential.

I get joy out of _flipping lives_.

Do you have dreams you'd love to pursue but you don't think you have the means to get there or the confidence to take the leap?

I've been there. I'd always wanted to spend more time with my wife and kids and to work on passion projects, but as the sole income in our household, I never felt I could take the risk.

I knew that there were people out there that lived differently and chased their dreams and I wanted to be one of them. So, I started reading and studying their methods, absorbing their practices and slowly changing my life.

Over time, my dreams became more vivid and in reach. My confidence grew, as did my bank account, and before I knew it we were in a position to do something crazy.

I [left my full-time job of 13 years to take a one-year mini-retirement]({% post_url 2017-07-11-one-year-mini-retirement %}) at home with my kids, working on this blog and writing code for fun.

It's been a dream come true.

### Your Journey

I can't count the number of times people have said they wished they could make a leap like this too.
The reality is that that _they can_ if they are willing to work for it - and _you can too_.

With the benefit of hindsight, I can save you from a lot of the missteps and distractions we experienced on our journey here.

As your coach, I'll help you:

1. Identify your biggest, most important dreams and values
2. Plot out how to make those goals a reality
3. Take control of your income, spending and schedule so you can invest in pursuing those dreams
4. Break free of the negative mental models that are keeping you from taking the leap

### Structure and Price

I charge a flat monthly fee for coaching, which includes a one-hour chat session (phone or video chat - your choice) as well as communicating via e-mail on an ongoing basis. While I have a rough structure for what we'll cover each month, every person is different, so we'll customize our discussions to your needs.

Dream timelines vary by person - depending on the size of the goal and how close you are today. With that in mind, one of my goals in coaching you is to equip you with the knowledge, habits, and routines to be self-sufficient in pursuing your dreams. If you have a 20-year goal, I certainly don't expect to be coaching you monthly for the next 20 years. We'll get you on your way and when you're ready, you can end our sessions. All I ask is that you shoot me an e-mail when you finally achieve your dream!
