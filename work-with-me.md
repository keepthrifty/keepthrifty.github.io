## Contributing to Keep Thrifty (Guest Posts)

If you'd like to write a guest post for Keep Thrifty, here's what I'm looking for:

- The title of the post you plan to write. Please don't submit generic topic ideas like "student loans" or "saving money" - I'd like to see an actual title and a couple sentence description of what you'd like to write about
- Guest posts should be no less than 1000 words. I don't have a strict upper limit, but anything over 3000 words is probably pushing it
- Please submit a link to an article that you wrote that you're especially _proud of_. I want a sample of your writing that you're excited to show off
- Guest posts are from __individuals__ (not businesses) and should be __promoting ideas__ (not products and services). If you don't fit in this category, see the section on Advertising/Sponsored Posts below

## Advertising/Sponsored Posts

At this time, I am not accepting requests for display advertising or submissions for sponsored posts.

## Affiliate Relationships

If you've got a product or service you think I'd like, use the form below to reach out with details. I only put affiliate links to products or services I use and can recommend to others. If you've got something that you think would be up my alley, reach out and tell me about it.

## Other Collaboration

Got something else in mind? Don't hesitate to reach out. I'm always up for hearing about new challenges :)
