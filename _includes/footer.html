          I'm not a certified financial planner or otherwise a financial expert; this blog just contains information and enertainment (if you can call it that). I can't promise that I didn't make a typo in my math or that what's represented in my posts is appropriate for you or anyone else. Proceed with caution and a sense of humor :)
