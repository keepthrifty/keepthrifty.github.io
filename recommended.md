On the path to financial freedom, we all invariably find tools and products that help us along the way. The ones you see below are ones that I currently use or have used in the past and can recommend based on my experience.

# Financial Tracking #

- [Thrifty][thrifty-link] is the way we __track our spending and income__ so we can get a top-to-bottom picture of our finances. Because Thrifty forces us to manually enter in each expense, we've become much more aware of where our money is going and the act of knowing we're going to have to log each expense has actually prevented us from spending on some things we really didn't need. Best of all, [Thrifty][thrifty-link] is __free__.
- [Mad Fientist FI Tracker][mad-fientist] is one of the coolest ways to __track your progress toward financial independence__. Track your net worth, spending, and savings each month to see how long you have until you reach financial independence. This one is __free__ too!

# Banking #

- \*[Capital One 360][capital-one-360] is what we use for our __checking and savings__ accounts. I especially love how easy it is to open up a new savings account (literally seconds and all online). We regularly open new accounts for special savings goals. The interest rate for savings accounts is pretty good compared to others you'll find out there!
- \*[Capital One Investing][capital-one-investing] is where I've got my __Roth IRA (Individual Retirement Account)__. There's a good number of mutual funds and ETFs you can get through here and it's available for __Traditional IRAs__ and __Taxable Investing__ as well.

# Books #

- \*[The 4-Hour Workweek: Escape 9-5, Live Anywhere, and Join the New Rich][four-hour-workweek]: I first read this book in 2010 and I really love the "think outside the box" mentality that Tim Ferris advocates. Being willing to __live differently__ than those around you and __experimenting in your life__ are two big concepts that started us down the path that we're on now.
- \*[Start with Why][start-with-why]: Quite simply, one of the more inspiring books I've read. This book helped me understand what drives me and what kind of __mark I want to make on the world__. My why is (roughly): _"I believe that there's almost always a better way to do things and that putting the knowledge and systems to do things better in peoples' hands can help them live better lives"_

# Household Products #

- \*Le Parfait jars ([3L set of three][three-L-jars], [3L single jar][three-L-jar], [2L set of three][two-L-jars], [2L single jar][two-L-jar], [1.5L set of three][one-and-half-L-jars], [1.5L single jar][one-and-half-L-jar], [1L set of three][one-L-jars], [1L single jar][one-L-jar], [0.5L single jar][half-L-jar]) are what we use for most of our __bulk food__ purchases. Bea Johnson at [Zero Waste Home][zero-waste-home] has been an inspiration, showing how mindful consumption can significantly reduce the waste you create. Beyond this, Bea's approach has allowed her and her family to have less wasteful spending since she's no longer paying for packaging for the goods she purchases. Eco-friendly and thrifty all bundled together :)
- \*[Worm composter][worm-composter]: this has been a fun experiment in our house, turning our food scraps back into __nutrient-dense compost__ that we can use in our garden and around our yard. Our kids are much more comfortable with worms because of the experience having these guys in our basement and we're excited to grow some amazing veggies in our garden using the compost. Don't forget to get [worms][worms] as well!
