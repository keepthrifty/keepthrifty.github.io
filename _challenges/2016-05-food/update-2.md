OK Thrifters, we made it to the end of the month, let's check how we did on bringing down our food spending for [this month's challenge][may-challenge-post].

![May final eating out - $310.35 total][may-2016-final-eating-out]

![May final grocery - $926.70 total][may-2016-final-grocery]

Knowing what we get from each place (and looking at the individual expenses as needed), here are the totals as compared to our original plan:

* _Groceries:_ $926.70 (vs expected $1000 - $1070)
* _Treats:_ $11.64 (vs expected $25)
* _Eating Out:_ $298.71 (vs expected $175 - $245)
  * _Family:_ $267.17
  * _Lunch at Work:_ $31.54
* __Total:__ $1237.05 (expected $1270)

So while I was a bit over/under on categories, overall we ended up better than the plan by $33!

We ended up dropping our _treats_ spending (which is typically ice cream from the local gas station) by getting more of this kind of purchase as a part of our groceries. We still ate out more than we would ideally, but overall I'm pleased with how the month turned out.

# Additional resources #

In the course of this month, I've come across a couple other resources that I think are worth taking a look at if you're looking to push further on your food spending.

- [Grass Fed Dry Aged Ribeye Steak][mr-and-mrs-pie] from Mrs. PIE at Plan.Invest.Escape (a great post on the 3 steps and 10 strategies they followed to drop their grocery spending from $1400/1500 a month to $1000 a month for a family of four)
- [Cutting Our Spending in 2016: Food, Phones and Fun][two-cup-house] from Two Cup House (talks about their high-level approach to cutting costs in food and other categories; based on their results and forecast post, they expect to cut from over $10k a year to just over $7k a year based on their changes)
- [Our Epically Frugal Lunch Recipe][frugalwoods] from Frugalwoods (the $0.39 a serving lunch that helped both the Frugalwoods and Two Cup House households make a big dent in food spending)
- [Breakfast: The Hidden Destroyer][frugalwoods-2] from Frugalwoods again (the $0.10 a serving breakfast they eat daily; between this and their lunch plan, they've really got things down!)
