Results for the first week of the [March challenge][march-challenge-post] are in.

![March week 1 results - $18.29 total][march-week-1-summary]

With a goal of spending $100 total this month, we're roughly on-track.  So far we've made a few purchases totaling $18.29

* Dish soap
* Toothpaste
* Compostable garbage bags
* Dental floss

Overall, this should represent the bulk of our spending for the month with the exception of a purchase or two of diapers and wipes at some point. Potty training is in progress, but we only have so much control over the timing :)

# How is your month looking? #

How is everything looking on your end? Hopefully you're making progress toward your goal. Keep focused, keep connected and, as always, keep thrifty!
