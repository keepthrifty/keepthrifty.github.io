Results for the second week of the [March challenge][march-challenge-post] are in.

![March week 2 results - $36.91 total][march-week-2-summary]

Our second week is on the books and we're still rolling strong. With a total goal this month of under $100, we're doing well with our week 2 total of $36.91.

Since [last week][last-week-post], we've added $18.82 with just a couple items:

* Diapers
* Toilet paper
* Glass spice jar

Still going strong here - the glass spice jar is an investment in our continuing move toward buying food in bulk - containers are a needed up-front expense but you save a ton from going in the trash and save money in the long run!

# How is your month looking? #

Hope you're on track as well. Find me on [twitter][twitter-profile] and let me know how you're doing!
