Now that March is officially over, the final results are in.

![March week 5 results - $94.00 total][march-final-summary]

With a grand total of $94.00, We finished out the month under our goal of $100!

Since [last week][last-week-post], we've added $20.69 to our household care total for March:

* 2 more [mason jars][mason-jars]
* Pull-ups
* 2 rolls toilet paper
* Vinegar (for cleaning)

We bought 2 more jars for my wife's [salad-in-a-jar lunch plan][salad-in-a-jar-post]; she's sticking with it - keeping healthy and keeping thrifty!

Beyond that, it was more staples - the standard stuff we get in this category that we can't reasonably cut out.

Overall, I'm proud of us for sticking under the $100.  Now for the big challenge - maintaining this in the coming months.

As I said when the challenge launched - these changes are intended to be sustainable; pushing from one month to another or one category isn't a real accomplishment.

From here on out, I'll report how we're doing on household care in the monthly summary for other challenges. By the time I get enough challenges under my belt, you'll probably get to see the majority of our monthly budget :)

# How is your month looking? #

I hope you were able to meet your goal as well. If you weren't, don't get discouraged - pick a new target and go from there.

Perfection is the enemy of good - make sure you're continuously improving; as long as you're doing that, you are headed in the right direction!

Find me on [twitter][twitter-profile] and let me know how you did this month!
