If you're looking for a blog about personal finance, spreadsheets, frugality, minimalism, faith, and living a purposeful life with intention, you've come to the right place. Welcome to Keep Thrifty!

I'm Chris - a husband, proud father of 3, and complete personal finance nerd.

I'm on a mission to get our family 100% debt-free (including our mortgage) by 2020. I started this blog as a way to share what I'm learning along the way so you can replicate my successes and avoid my mistakes.

We're focused on three big goals and approaches at the moment:

## Living Better with Less ##

We don't get much enjoyment out of stuff, so we tend to focus on experiences instead ([with a few exceptions]({% post_url 2016-07-14-experience-or-stuff %})). We'd describe ourselves as minimalists, mostly because we've found that life is a lot more fun when you don't have the "mental tax" of too much stuff weighing you down.

In addition, keeping our possessions to a reasonable level gives us additional flexibility and keeps our money in our bank accounts instead of tied up in items in our closets.

We even [sold my wife's engagement ring]({% post_url 2016-03-23-engagement-ring-sold %}), not because we needed to - because we could free ourselves of one more possession and redirect that money to our current goals.

## Achieving 100% debt freedom by 2020 ##

One of our biggest goals is free ourselves from as many financial burdens in life as we can. Step one is to achieve 100% debt freedom and we've set an ambitious goal of getting there by 2020.

As a single-income family of five, this isn't always easy, but we are blessed to be free of student loans, [auto loans]({% post_url 2016-05-08-how-much-car-can-you-afford %}), and any consumer debt.

All that's left is our mortgage and [we're paying it down as fast as we can]({% post_url 2016-04-10-how-we-saved-on-our-mortgage %}).

## Traveling to all 50 states in the United States with our kids before they turn 18 ##

Family time is number one and we've been building memories for the last few years through [road tripping]({% post_url 2016-07-06-roadtrip-recap %}).

With 28 states already under our belt, we are on-track to get to all 50 by the time our oldest daughter is 10!

Every trip we take brings us closer as a family, builds memories we'll carry for a lifetime, and challenges us as a family to grow and mature as we encounter new situations.
