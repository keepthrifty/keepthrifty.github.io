## A single-income family on the path to financial independence ##

<img src="/img/us.png" class="page-image">

Hi! I'm Chris and it's great to have you here. I'm a proud husband and father working on achieving financial independence for our family despite living on only a single income.

We've been working at it seriously for about two years now and have made some great progress. We're down to no consumer debt (just our mortgage) and we're on track to pay that off in the next 4 or so years.

KeepThrifty is where I can share what we've learned about finance and provide insight into what we're doing to get to financial freedom so others can do the same.

In addition, KeepThrifty is a place where I can pursue another of my passions - software development. I'll be bringing you tools and calculators to help you better understand and visualize your finances.

The big kahuna here is [Thrifty][thrifty-link] - the expense tracking tool I created and have been using to figure out where we spend our money so we can spend less and live better.

You can find me here, on [Twitter][twitter-link], and on [Google+][google-plus-link].

Keep in touch and as always, Keep Thrifty!

-Chris
