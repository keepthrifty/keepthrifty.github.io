If you're looking for a blog about personal finance, spreadsheets, frugality, minimalism, faith, and living a purposeful life with intention, you've come to the right place. Welcome to Keep Thrifty!

I'm Chris - a husband, proud father of 3, and complete personal finance nerd.

I'm on a mission to get our family 100% debt-free (including our mortgage) by 2020. I started this blog as a way to share what I'm learning along the way so you can replicate my successes and avoid my mistakes.

Money isn't the end goal; it's just a tool that we can use to help us get where we want to be.

## Travel to all 50 states in the United States with our kids before they turn 18 ##

Right now, we are on-track to get there by the time our oldest is 10! Every trip we take brings us closer as a family, builds memories we'll carry for a lifetime, and challenges us as a family to grow and mature as we encounter new situations.

Our preferred method is [road tripping]({% post_url 2016-07-06-roadtrip-recap %}), but we're excited to do portions by trains and planes as well.
