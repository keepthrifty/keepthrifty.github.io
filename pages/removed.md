As minimalists, we declutter in our digital homes the same way we declutter our regular homes. From time to time, we go through our old posts and remove old content that we think is no longer providing value.

We're sorry to say that the file you're looking for was a part of one of those sweeps.

We do this to keep our site focused on the best content. Check out some of our favorites below - you're sure to find something you'll like!

-Chris and Jaime
