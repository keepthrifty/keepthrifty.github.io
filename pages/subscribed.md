<div class="image-caption">Do you see the smiles you put on our faces?</div>

We are so excited you've decided to join the Keep Thrifty community!

We send out an email with every new post that includes a link and a short personal update from one of us. You can expect to see those on _Tuesday and Thursday morning at 7:15 AM (Central Time)_.

But before you get there, you'll need to confirm your email address.

## __IMPORTANT: Confirm your email address__

Typos happen from time-to-time and sometimes a cat just decides to lay on your keyboard causing all hell to break loose...

So please, go check your inbox. You should see an email titled _"Welcome to Keep Thrifty"_. In that e-mail you'll just have to click one little link and then you'll be good to go.

_P.S. If you're the cat, please stop bothering your owner. Go find a sunny spot on the carpet to lay on. I'll get the laser pointer if that'll help._
