## Welcome to Keep Thrifty - I'm Chris

If you're like most of my readers, you're looking to do something different.

You've got big dreams underneath the surface and want to make them a reality. You've felt stuck by never-enough finances and overloaded schedules and are ready to take control and chase your dreams.

This site is a resource to help you be diligent about how you spend your money and your time. If you're using them carefully to support your values and achieve your dreams, then you've got a Keep Thrifty mindset.

If not, there's still time to make a change.

## I've Been Stuck Too

A few years back, it looked like I had everything going for me - a stable corporate job, [a beautiful wife](http://www.jaimedeclutters.com){: target="_blank"} and three daughters, a house in the suburbs, two new cars in the garage, and a house full of stuff.

But outward appearances can be deceiving. Despite all of the things we had, we were lacking something big - happiness.

Over the course of the last several years, we've flipped our family's life - ending our frivolous spending and love for the artificial so we could focus on living out our dreams and values.

Going through this gave us the ability to do something big - for me to leave my full-time job to commit to a [one-year mini-retirement]({% post_url 2017/2017-07-11-one-year-mini-retirement %}).

It's crazy. It's unconventional. But it's also incredible - and it's possible for you too.

## Everyone Should Have the Chance to Chase Their Dreams

It isn't always easy, but it's way better than spending the rest of your life asking "What if?"

Keep Thrifty is my way of sharing what we've learned with others so they can dare to dream big, understand how to take control of their finances and time, and make their dreams a reality.
