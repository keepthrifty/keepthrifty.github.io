<div class="image-caption">You joining the community makes us do this &uarr;</div>

We are so excited you've decided to join the Keep Thrifty community! To start getting e-mails, there's just one more thing for you to do:

## __Confirm your email address__

Typos happen from time-to-time; sometimes a cat just decides to lay on your keyboard causing all hell to break loose...

So _please, go check your inbox_ so we know you're not just some cat.

You should see an email titled _"Welcome to Keep Thrifty!"_. In that e-mail you'll just have to click one little link and then you'll be good to go.

Plus, when you click the link, you'll get a free copy of our _"5 Steps to a Mini-Retirement"_ cheat sheet. Yay freebies!

_P.S. If you're the cat, please stop bothering your owner. Go find a sunny spot on the carpet to lay on. I'll get the laser pointer if that'll help._
