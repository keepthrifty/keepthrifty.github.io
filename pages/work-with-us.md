## Sponsored Articles

{% include image.html path="/assets/img/work-with-us/sponsor.jpg" preload="/assets/img/work-with-us/sponsor-preload.svg" alt="Team of hands together" %}{: class="image--right"}

We provide sponsored articles as a part of our [Freedom Story series]({{site.url}}/freedom-stories), with a particular format. Sponsored articles must highlight a success story of one of your users in how your product or service helped them achieve a dream.

Our first step is to determine if your product or service is a good fit for our readers. If we believe it could help them achieve their goals, then we'll move forward.

Submissions can either be written by someone from your team or Jaime can work with your user directly to form the freedom story herself.

These articles include a _nofollow_ link to your product or service. The article will be promoted in our email list and social media channels along with our other content.
