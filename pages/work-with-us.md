Do you have a concept for your website that's best explained with an accompanying calculator? Using plugins and other tools to create your own can be a challenge and what happens when something goes wrong?

Chris is a math nerd, spreadsheet fanatic, and software developer. He'd love to turn your concept into an easy-to-use tool for your viewers. Chris has experience building calculators for multiple web platforms including Wordpress and Jekyll.

Here are some examples of his work:
