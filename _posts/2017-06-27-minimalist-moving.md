Most people wouldn't put the process of moving from one home to the next very high on their list of favorite activities. For most, it's an expensive, stressful process that requires weeks of planning. Our family is about to be a part of the millions of people that will move this year, but we're hoping our minimalist lifestyle provides for a very different experience.

## Our Last Move - What We Brought

When we moved into this house, we were two recent college graduates. My wife had just graduated and I had been out for over two years. For both of us, our possessions were very much "college gear" - the furniture, place settings, etc that we had carried around with us over our time in school.

At a high level, here's what we brought when we moved in 10 years ago:

- Bed (full) with pillows, sheets, comforter, etc
- Futon with pillows, sheets, comforter, etc
- Night stand
- Three dressers
- Tons of pillows (throw pillows, floor pillows, sitting pillows)
- Couch and love seat set
- Coffee table
- End table
- Two floor lamps
- Two table lamps
- Two TV stands
- Two TVs
- Two desks
- Two desk chairs
- Two desk lamps
- One desktop computer with monitor
- One laptop
- File cabinet
- A whiteboard
- Dining room table with chairs
- Two stools
- Two full sets of plates, bowls, silverware, and cookware
- Enough clothes to last both of us 2+ weeks without doing laundry

Not included here was the endless boxes and bins of paperwork, toiletries, sentimental items, and...junk.

When we moved into this 1900 square-foot house, the items above seemed so inadequate. The amount of space in this house that was empty felt embarrassing.

We tried to find uses for the empty spaces in our house.

_That bedroom could be an office._

_Should we use that one as a guest room?_

_Which living room should we put the couch and love seat in?_

It quickly became obvious that we _"needed"_ to buy more stuff but we didn't have the money to buy everything right away. We were disciplined enough to [avoid financing furniture](http://www.makingsenseofcents.com/2017/06/financing-furniture.html), but we weren't able to recognize that we didn't need more furniture at all.

Over the next several years, we filled each room, buying new couches, new desks, new coffee tables, new beds, and so on. Throw clothes, kitchen items, and the addition of kids (which meant toys, toys, toys) and we ended up with a house full of stuff like most families.

## Fast Forward to Today

If you've been following along, you know that we've taken a sharp course change over the last couple years. We [cut the volume of most of our possessions in half]({% post_url 2016-10-10-become-twice-as-happy-with-half-as-much %}), and in other cases, even more.

Today, our list of what we're moving out is a whole lot shorter:

- 5 sleeping bags and pillows
- Futon
- Full-length mirror
- Kitchen table
- 5 Folding chairs
- Sets of plates, bowls, silverware, and cookware
- Enough clothes to last each of the five of us 1 week without doing laundry
- 3 kids bicycles, a wagon, a stroller, and some outdoor toys
- A few boxes of toys, sentimental items, and seasonal items

As we've chipped away at getting things packed up over the last few weeks, we've come to a stark realization.

## Moving as a Minimalist

What this means is that this move is going to look a whole lot different for us than moves in the past.

### A Cheaper Move

While we wouldn't have planned on paying a moving service, we almost certainly would have needed to rent a moving truck. Just getting a quick cost estimate, the smallest truck we could get for our move date after taxes, fees, and making multiple trips would have cost $150.

Because of how we've downsized our stuff, I'm estimating we'll be able to make the full move in 2-4 trips with our minivan.

### A Cheaper Place

Because [we've practiced living smaller]({% post_url 2017-04-10-living-in-half-of-our-house %}), we're able to drop from four bedrooms to three, from two living rooms to one, and from three bathrooms to two. Looking at comparable rentals, we're saving $745 a month if we hadn't been able to make that change.

In addition, by being a [one car family]({% post_url 2017-01-16-one-car-suburbs %}), we were able to get an apartment with a one-car garage instead of a two-car garage. For comparable units, this is saving us $175 a month.

Put those two together and our housing cost is roughly half of what it had been. Instead of an $1895/month lease, we were able to lock in at $975/month, saving us $11,000 in rent next year.

### Way Less Stress

We don't have a ton of items to take apart and reassemble. We don't have boxes upon boxes of unknown items that we're hauling, hoping that it's worth the effort to lug them out to the van, and up the stairs to our new place.

We're already going to have enough going on with moving our family of five. Knowing that my wife and I can do the move ourselves in one day takes a lot of the stress out.

## Moving if You're Not a Minimalist (yet)

I wouldn't recommend minimizing your stuff _only_ for the sake of having an easy move. That said, the benefits of downsizing your things reach far and wide - from the financial to the mental and spiritual.

If you _are_ going to be moving, it's the perfect time to take a look at what you really need.

Here are some tips as you get ready for moving day:

- Before you box each item up, consider whether you've used it in the last 6 months and whether you really will use it in the next 6 months. If you have items that are already in a box from your last move that you never unpacked, it's a great indicator you can do without them.
- Beware the three most dangerous words: __just in case__. Especially if it's a low-cost item that you could replace quickly, you should [seriously consider ditching these items](http://www.theminimalists.com/jic/).
- Sentimental items are great for sparking memories. Remember, they can't do that job if they are sitting in a box in your basement. [Pick the few items you would love to see daily](http://www.jaimedeclutters.com/blog/2016/10/16/love-our-sentimental-items/) and put them on display. For the rest, consider giving them to someone else that would find meaning in them. Otherwise, a great way to honor those memories is to give those items new life by donating them to a good cause.

Finally, remember that minimizing your stuff doesn't end once you've moved in. One of the great minimizing techniques from The Minimalists is [the packing party](http://www.theminimalists.com/packing/). If you're already moving and putting everything in boxes, you might as well give this a shot. Resist the urge to unpack everything when you move in. Keep everything in its box until you are actually going to use it. After a few months, take note of how much is in boxes and start thinking about what you can part with.

Even with how little we own, we plan to follow the packing party mentality with this move just to see where we're at.
