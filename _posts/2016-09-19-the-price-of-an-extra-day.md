How much money does an extra day of financial freedom cost? While it seems like a pretty cool philosophical question, there's actually a way you can calculate it to the penny. Here's the theory, the math, and the free calculators for you to get your own quote on the cost of a day of freedom.

Catching up on some podcasts recently, I was amped to see a [new episode of the Mad Fientist podcast][mad-fientist-podcast] with three amazing guests - [Mr. Money Mustache](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com), [Paula Pant from Afford Anything](http://www.affordanything.com), and [Doug Nordman from The Military Guide](http://the-military-guide.com/).

It's not often you get to hear a lineup like this all at the same time, so I dove right in. Partway through, someone asked how people kept motivated while working toward financial independence (FI) and Mr. Money Mustache (MMM) responded with this:

> At the end of each workday —I worked on the fourth floor of this 4-story building — I remember I was kind of like jumping down the stairs at the end of each work day zigzagging down to where I parked my bike. I remember thinking, “Okay, that’s another $400 or whatever which is another”—and I would calculate how many more weeks closer I’d pulled in my retirement because, by that time, $400 earned that day, I wasn’t going to be able to spend until 20 years in the future, so it would’ve compounded to thousands of dollars.
>
> So, anyway, I was like, “Yeah, I just subtracted another 39 days from my work life.” Little mental games like that just made it feel like I had accomplished a lot in one boring day.

# Whoa #

It's a cool thought - correlating what impact your day at work has on your retirement, but if you notice, MMM didn't just think about it, he actually ___calculated___ it.

With my addiction to [spreadsheets]({{ site.url }}/tags#spreadsheets), I naturally took some time to figure out the math and put together a quick sheet to let anyone figure out what the impact of an extra day or an extra dollar is on their retirement.

I translated these back into a couple tools below that you can use - feel free to put your own numbers in and see how it turns out!

> Note: because this is trying to look just at the impact of a set dollar amount now, this assumes that you don't plan _any_ other contributions to your retirement savings in the future

> The cool part is that you can then use this in the MMM example of understanding how much retirement time you bank for every day you work by simply plugging in the amount you put into retirement savings for each work day

# My Numbers #

The most fun part for me here was to crunch my numbers and see a few things:

1. If I stopped contributing to my retirement accounts right now and didn't ever put another penny in, I'd still be able to retire at age 68 and 8 months
2. For every day of work, I bank 3.1 days of retirement just based on 401k contributions (mine and company match). When you throw in our current additional savings, it goes up to 6.3 days banked per day worked
3. For the low price of $24.47, I can buy a day of retirement

<div class="image-caption">Mind blown!</div>

My mind was blown when I realized I could buy a day of FI for $25

Every time I have something that comes out to a $25-30 expense, I'm going to have this running through my head and I hope it becomes a motivator to make good trade-offs on a day-to-day basis.

Now I just need to find some $25 things to forego and invest the money so I can start pulling that date in beyond what working will already do :)

Rolling it up, the cost of one year of FI at this point in my journey would be $9175.61

# General Rules #

Playing around with the calculators, there are some interesting truisms here that surface:

1. The earlier you are in your FI journey, the bigger the impact. If you've got $30,000 in retirement accounts today, you can buy an extra day of retirement for $5; a whole year only costs $1,878.
3. Notice (strangely) that we can do all this math without even knowing what your expected expenses are in retirement. While it may seem counterintuitive, the math backs it up (see below).

# The Math Behind the Tools #

For the math nerds like me, I'll take the rest of this article to show the math behind the tools. _If you're not interested, [skip to the bottom](#post-closing) to share the post, subscribe for more financial awesomeness via e-mail, see some related posts, or leave a comment._

For the mathematical masochists, check out these images of the math I used. It felt like a return to middle and high-school math for me to go through this but it was fun to actually figure things out.
