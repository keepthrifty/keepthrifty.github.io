We're through week three of the [March challenge][march-challenge-post] and lookin' good!

![March week 3 results - $63.83 total][march-week-3-summary]

Three weeks down and roughly a week and a half to go; so at this point we should have spent about $64.50 (20 days / 31 days times $100) and we're currently just under at $63.83.

Since [last week][week-2-update], we've added $26.92 to our household care total for March:

* Pull-Ups
* Conditioner
* Apple Cider Vinegar (for fruit fly traps)
* 2 [Mason Jars][mason-jars]

The mason jars are for my wife's new lunch plan - [salad-in-a-jar][salad-in-a-jar-video]. Pre-making tasty lunches from raw ingredients is a great way to keep healthy and keep thrifty, so it's well worth the investment in mason jars.

![Salad in a mason jar][salad-in-a-jar]
<div class="image-caption">Yellow bell pepper, cucumber, cherry tomatoes, red onion, olives, and homemade dressing</div>

Overall, we're still on track. Keeping within budget despite the originally unplanned mason jars makes me feel good that we're in a maintainable state for the future :)

## How is your month looking? #
