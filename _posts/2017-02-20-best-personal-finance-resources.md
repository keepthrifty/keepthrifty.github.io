- [Freakonomics Radio](http://freakonomics.com/archive/){: target="_blank"} - Steven Dubner explores economics in the true sense (not just financial) - trying to understand the forces in the universe that drive human behavior.

## Favorite Tools and Spreadsheets

- [Thrifty](/thrifty/) - There are lots of ways to track your finances. I didn't love any of them, so I created my own web app to get exactly what I needed and I provide it _free_ for anyone to use.
- [Mad FIentist Lab](https://lab.madfientist.com/sign_up){: target="_blank"} - The Mad FIentist has some great calculators here but the biggest thing is the Financial Independence calculator. Just log a few numbers each month and he'll tell you when you're due to hit financial independence.
- [FamZoo's Virtual Family Bank](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=253266&u=1516811&m=29165&urllink=&afftrack=){: rel="nofollow" target="_blank"} - an awesome way to teach your kids how to earn and spend money responsibly. Your kids can earn money from you and use their own debit card to spend what they earn without the risk of overdrafting your account.
- [The Price of a Day of Retirement Calculator]({% post_url 2016-09-18-the-price-of-an-extra-day %}) - How much would you have to invest today to retire a day earlier? I've got a calculator for that :)
- [Retirement Freedom Spreadsheet]({% post_url 2017-01-30-introducing-retirement-freedom %}) - Wouldn't it be awesome if you had enough money today to know you could retire at age 65 even if you never contributed another penny? I put together a spreadsheet to tell you if you're there and, if not, how much further you've got to go.
- [The Ultimate Refinancing Spreadsheet]({% post_url 2016-12-12-ultimate-refinancing-spreadsheet-calculator %}) - Most refinancing calculators aren't built for people who are on a debt destruction journey. Unsatisfied with the options out there, I made one that is.
