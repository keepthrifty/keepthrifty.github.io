I used to __love__ Diet Mountain Dew. That might not even be a strong enough statement - I was pretty much addicted to it. It was my source of caffeine and one of those self-indulgent "treats" I convinced myself I needed.

I was drinking at least a bottle (20 oz) a day for a number of years and at times was going through more.

Back in the summer of 2014, my wife challenged me to an experiment - to see if I could go our whole roadtrip (10 days) without drinking any.

As a replacement, my wife offered up coffee which has never suited my tastes but I knew the health benefits were there and I love a good challenge so I took her up on it.

Surprisingly the transition wasn't as tough as I had thought and while I had a bit between the end of the roadtrip and late 2014, I'm proud to say that I haven't had any in well over a year and don't see going back.

While the health benefits are reason enough on their own, this is a personal finance blog, so let's talk about the surprisingly big financial impact this little change had.

## Basic numbers #

At my worst, I was drinking more than a bottle a day, but let's be conservative and go with one a day. At $1.50 each, that's $550 a year.

As a replacement, we bought a [grinder][ham-beach-80350] and a [french press][french-press] and we buy our coffee beans in bulk from the grocery store. We get the good stuff so we pay $10.96 a pound.

![Coffee cup filled with beans][coffee-cup]

<div class="image-caption">Maybe this is why it always comes out so crunchy?</div>

With [100 tablespoons per pound][coffee-lb-to-tablespoons] and 4 tablespoons per cup (we like it strong), that gives us a cost of about 44 cents a cup for what I drink at home.

At work, we have a community coffee machine that pumps out medium-strength [Folgers][folgers] all day long. While not my favorite, it does the trick and the cost is a lot less. A 3-lb tub is about $15 which translates to 15 cents a cup for work.

I drink about one cup a day when I'm home and closer to three a day when I'm at work, so I average 45 cents a day for my caffeine intake now.

For current prices, I only spend $160 a year on coffee instead of $550 a year on soda and get the health benefits of not putting toxic chemicals in my body.

From here, let's take a look both at the impact on how much I save between now and retirement by switching as well as the impact on how much I need to accumulate in my retirement account to fund my caffeine intake.

## Impact on amount needed to retire #

Most financial aficionados will tell you to follow the [4% rule][four-percent-rule] to determine your target for how much to have in your retirement accounts to allow you to retire.

If you're not familiar, take 4% of the number in your retirement account - if you can live for the next year spending that amount, you probably don't need this blog - there's a good chance you could go retire right now. :)

### Determining savings needed from expenses ##

To work from expenses to the amount needed in your account for retirement, you just reverse it:

1. Take your expected annual expenses at retirement
2. Multiply that number by 25 (the equivalent of dividing by 4%)

That tells you how much you need in your retirement account in order to retire with a good level of confidence that your expenses will be covered for the long haul if you just take out 4% of the balance of your account each year.

The beauty of the 4% rule is that you can apply it to groups of expenses to calculate the retirement savings burden of each guilty pleasure you want to continue.

### Soda retirement burden vs coffee retirement burden

If I want to cover my soda habit in retirement at age 65, I need 25 times the annual expense of my soda habit in my account when I retire.

Based on expected inflation (3%) bringing it to $1400 a year, that's just over $35,000 I need in retirement savings just to cover soda.

With coffee instead, inflation gets us up to $420 a year, which means I only need $10,000 in savings to cover coffee instead

All told, switching to coffee drops the amount I need in my savings to retire by the difference between these two - $25,000.

In other words:

> By switching from soda to coffee, I reduce the amount I need to save for retirement by $25,000

At this point, you're probably thinking something like this:

![Boxing match - fighter labeled coffee winning over fighter labeled Diet Mt. Dew][coffee-vs-dew]

<div class="image-caption">Diet Mt. Dew looks so disappointed here; sorry buddy - it isn't personal</div>

While I don't disagree, we can't stop here - we've only figured out one of the two benefits of the switch and - get this - that was the __smaller__ number :)

## Impact on savings #

On the flip side, let's look at what we can do with the money we save between now and retirement by switching.

Again, I'd be spending about $1400 a year on soda by the time I would hit normal retirement at age 65.

Instead, by switching to coffee and investing the difference every year in retirement savings (assume an investment account at 8% return), I'd have an extra $77,000 in my retirement account by age 65.

> No, that wasn't a typo - that's a seven, then another seven, and then three zeroes.

That's the beauty of compound interest my friends - putting in a few hundred dollars a year over 33 years gets you a pretty healthy chunk of change at the end!

## All together now #

So, at age 65, I have an extra $77,000 in my retirement account and I need $25,000 less than I would have if I were a lifelong soda drinker.

That's a savings swing of $102,000 at retirement just by switching from soda to coffee in my early 30's.

![Stop the music][stop-the-music]

I think I just heard a couple jaws hitting keyboards.

This is the crazy, powerful math you get when you put interest and long timelines together - small changes get you big numbers.

Let me put it back in perspective - by spending about $30 less per month on my caffeine habit and being smart with that savings, I can have a $102,000 benefit at retirement.

I'd consider getting one of those big novelty checks you see at golf tournaments but we're pretty minimalist and I don't think banks actually take those, do they?

## What's in your cup? #

If a $30/month reduction now can benefit $102,000 at retirement, what would happen from whittling down expenses by $100, $200, or $500 a month?

This post isn't really about soda - it's about the big power of small changes in your financial habits.

Knowing what kind of impact small changes can have on long-term finances, here's the question for you:

_What is one recurring expense that you could really live without?_
