Last year, we set an audacious goal to become completely debt-free by 2020 by prepaying down our mortgage. We accomplished that goal this month by selling our house and moving into an apartment. While this has been a huge change, it's just a piece of our even bigger life change - I parted ways with my employer at the end of June. I'm now unemployed.

Years ago, I would have had six or seven panic attacks at the thought of losing my steady paycheck - especially since I'm our family's only income source. Thanks to the financial discipline we've developed, I recognize today that this isn't a crisis; it's an incredible opportunity.

Rather than scrambling to find my next job, _I'm going to take the next year off of work as a mini-retirement_.

## How We Can Afford To Be A No-Income Family

Our ability to make this leap is the result of of three things we've been working hard at developing over the last several years:

1. Financial discipline
2. Courage to prioritize our dreams over social norms
3. Faith in God and in ourselves

Consider these the legs of the stool - without all three, we wouldn't have a chance of making this work.

### Financial Discipline

We had been targeting debt freedom as a first step toward a bigger goal - financial independence (FI). We were excited at the thought of _not owing anyone anything_ and eventually getting to the point that I wouldn't need to work to support our lifestyle.

We cultivated a sense of financial discipline - remembering that our bigger life goals were more important than the temporary high of consumerist purchases. With what we saved, aggressively [paid down our mortgage]({% post_url 2016-04-10-how-we-saved-on-our-mortgage %}). With every raise or promotion, we kept our spending unaffected, [redirecting our income increases to paying off our debt]({% post_url 2016-01-15-prepaying-mortgage-trick %}). This year, we even took on a big challenge of trying to [go the whole year buying nothing new]({% post_url 2017-01-02-happy-nothing-new-year %}). While we haven't been perfect, our spending has come down.

But it's a long game - financial independence. With all of our progress, we were on track to be financially independent by my 48th birthday - almost 13 years away. Retiring 17 years early is a wonderful gift, but knowing you have 13 years to go can be a challenge _(Side note: If you want to know your FI date, check out the awesome tools in the [Mad FIentist Laboratory](https://lab.madfientist.com/){: target="_blank"}_

So, in January, I did what I always do - I made a spreadsheet. That spreadsheet calculated when I could theoretically stop saving for retirement and know that I'd still be able to retire at age 65. Thus, the ["Retirement Freedom" calculator]({% post_url 2017-01-30-introducing-retirement-freedom %}) was born.

When I originally did the math, I hadn't included my expected pension or social security income and it looked like we were due to hit retirement freedom around the same time as debt freedom - mid-2020.

Once I factored in my pension income, I realized that we were already there.

_We could stop contributing to my retirement accounts now and still expect to have our retirement expenses covered._

Even though full financial independence was over a decade away, I felt a huge burden off my shoulders. And then I remembered something from a book I had read in 2007 that completely changed the way I think.

### Courage To Prioritize Our Dreams Over Social Norms

I read [The Four-Hour Workweek by Tim Ferriss](http://amzn.to/2smqaQr){: target="_blank" rel="nofollow"}, not knowing what to expect. Beyond the cool concepts of optimizing and automating, the most impactful lesson from this book was about bucking social norms in the pursuit of your ideal life.

[Through our past]({% post_url 2017-06-13-our-not-so-thrifty-past %}), we'd spent so much time and money on things that weren't true to our values and dreams. These were the things that the world around us said we needed to be happy. We found that they weren't very good at providing that happiness because they hadn't come from _our_ dreams and values - they had come from ads and envy.

As we realized this, we dove into a deep journey of decluttering - not just our stuff but our mental models of the world. We had to clear out the opinions and expectations that came from outside so we could have clarity to what was important.

_In essence, we hit the reset button for our stuff and our view of the world._

We made big changes - we [sold my wife's engagement ring]({% post_url 2016-03-23-engagement-ring-sold %}) and wedding dress, we [downsized to one car]({% post_url 2017-01-16-one-car-suburbs %}), and we sold or donated our [unnecessary furniture, TV, and clothes]({% post_url 2016-10-10-become-twice-as-happy-with-half-as-much %}).

Every step gave us a bigger sense of freedom as we decoupled from the artificial aspects of our lives.

As I came to the conclusion that we had achieved retirement freedom and now only had to focus on what we wanted to do between now and retirement, I remembered another key concept from [The Four-Hour Workweek](http://amzn.to/2smqaQr){: target="_blank" rel="nofollow"} - the mini-retirement.

Rather than wait until you're 65 to take time for yourself and focus on what's most important, Tim Ferriss advocates for spreading your retirement time out over your life, taking mini-retirements.

Always wanted to backpack across Europe? Want to sail around the world? Want to set up a workshop and become an expert carpenter? Figure out how much it will cost you to do it, save for it, and then do it. Now.

So, as we asked ourselves what we wanted to do in the next 30 years, we went back to our [financial compass]{% post_url 2016-12-05-money-mistakes-financial-compass %} for direction.

Here are the things we said we wanted:

- Maximizing the time we can spend together and the quality of that time
- Making time to pursue the work that brings us joy
- Living a life that reflects Godâ€™s calling for us

With our compass as our guide and our financial discipline and courage for the unorthodox as our tools, we suddenly gained clarity into the life we could have now.

__TK - GE situation arose __

With our plan to sell our house and downsize, we had unwittingly freed up the equity in our house to fund an experiment of an even bigger dream: _me being home - spending more time with my wife and kids, and working on this blog and [Thrifty]({{site.url}}/thrifty/)_.

But there's a big difference between wanting a huge life change like this and actually having the faith to take the leap.

### Faith in God and in Ourselves

_TK experiments_

Our kids are young (6, 5, and 5) and I know from everyone I've talked to that _they will grow up too fast_. These moments are precious and every opportunity to be a more present dad is one I want to capture. The opportunity to spend a year at home is an amazing gift.


- We spent the last several years working hard to better align our spending with our values
- Now we're making the bigger, tougher leap - to align our time with our values

- Our values - what we'll be spending time (and money) on
  - Faith
    - praying daily (habit app)
  - Family
    - everyone says kids grow up too fast; trying to act on that
  - Fun
    - always wanted to be my own boss - work on my own thing.
    - How this ties to KT/Thrifty
      - KT - new focus (Thrifty definition)
      - Thrifty - new focus - new features, better support/info, and exiting beta

- The death bed test

- Fulfillment comes from applying your limited resources (time and money) to achieve your dreams while staying true to your values.
