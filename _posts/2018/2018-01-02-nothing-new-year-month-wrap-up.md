We made it! We're officially through our [Nothing New Year]({% post_url 2017/2017-01-02-happy-nothing-new-year %}) challenge and it's been a wild ride. We were far from perfect, but that doesn't mean that the challenge was a failure.

I consider it a success because it definitely made a positive impact on our finances and our environmental footprint - and we learned a ton!

Since we're wrapping things up, I'll have an abbreviated spending overview for December as well as a full-year summary of our 2018 spending and what we learned from the Nothing New Year Challenge.

## December Spending Overview

_We track our spending using a little tool I made called [Thrifty](https://thrifty.keepthrifty.com). It's in development right now, so I'm providing it for free. It's pretty awesome and has helped us get a handle on our finances over the last 2 years. Check it out!_

Here's our spending summary from Thrifty for December 2017:

![Overall spending $TK]({{site.url}}/assets/img/posts/2018-01-02-nothing-new-year-wrap-up/nny-month-twelve-spending.png)

I'd consider it a fairly reasonable month - especially considering our purchases for Christmas and our upcoming Hawaii trip were all within this number.

Let's dive into to the details of each category:

|----+-------+---------------|
| Category | Amount  | Notes |
|:----:+------:+---------------|
| Charity  | $100.00 | We continued our regular contributions to our church and [The Hope Effect](http://hopeeffect.com/){: target="_blank"}, one of our favorite charities. |
| Childcare | $0.00 | We missed bible study this month because Jaime wasn't feeling well, so we didn't need a sitter. |
| Clothing/Shoes | $654.85 | Yowza! This month was a tough one - we bought a mix of used and new. On the used side: a set of snow pants, shirts, pants. On the ___new___ side: a t-shirt and skort for each of our girls, a sweater for Chris, a tank top for Jaime, snowpants for Jaime and one of our girls, undershirts and socks for Chris, two sets of winter boots, and a swimsuit for Jaime. All told (and removing the exceptions), we bought 10 ___new___ clothing items this month. |
| Date Night | $0.00 | We didn't have any date nights this month. Oops! |
| Eating Out | $83.28 | We had two convenience meals this month (getting take-out instead of our planned dinner) and bought _quite a bit of ice cream_. Is it crazy that we buy ice cream in the winter? It's one of those things everyone in our family loves. |
| Education | $146.62 | Our school had _another_ fundraiser for new playground equipment, so we contributed to that. Also, we had to buy candy for the kids to make gingerbread houses in their classes. Finally, we got gift cards and thank you cards for our kids' teachers to thank them for the __amazing__ work they do. |
| Entertainment | $0.00 | We got all our movies and books from the library this month for free - score! |
| Fitness | $0.00 | We prepaid our gym membership, so nothing this month. |
| Gifts & Celebrations | $388.17 | We stayed well within our Christmas budget of $500, but did end up buying a fair amount new. We looked for used where we could, but ran out of luck for some purchases, buying 10 ___new___ items. |
| Groceries | $714.68 | Once again, we did fairly well this month on groceries! |
| Healthcare | $722.47 | Health insurance premiums, 5 chiropractic visits for Jaime, and 3 office visits. Jaime's chiropractic schedule is down to one adjustment a week (from 2 before) so hopefully we'll see this number drop in the coming months. |
| Hobbies | $0.00 | Our art supplies from last month are holding out and the kids got some art stuff as Christmas presents from family as well. |
| Home Updates | $0.00 | The rental life is treating us well here :) |
| Household Care | $377.47.58 | Lots of standard stuff: toilet paper, surface cleaner, dish soap, hair clips, floss, chapstick, make up, candles, shampoo, conditioner. We also had five ___new___ purchases this month - three travel car seats, a corkscrew, and a handwoven basket to hold our family card games so they aren't in the back of some drawer. Finally, we had to get replacement frames for our daughter's glasses after the old ones broke. We're considering this to be on the exception list as something we can't get used. |
| Pizza & Movie Night | $81.74 | With five pizza nights this month, we spent quite a bit. We used Papa Murphy's twice to keep the cost down a bit, but have been craving our local favorite pizza shop. |
| Services | $109.72 | Life insurance, printing a few pages at the library, and a deposit for family photos that we'll be taking during our January trip to Hawaii. |
| Shelter | $975.00 | Rent |
| Thrifty | $57.69 | Hosting fees, email management tool, and source code storage for [Thrifty](https://thrifty.keepthrifty.com) this month. |
| Transportation | $84.55 | With a bit of travel around the holidays, we needed extra gas this month, consuming two full tanks. |
| Travel | $597.91 | We booked a rental car for our trip to Hawaii and prepaid for a hotel (and parking) the night before our flight in Chicago. |
| Utilities | $149.46 | Internet and gas and electric. |
|-------+----------+----|
| __Total__ | __$5,243.61__ | Total without Travel: $4,645.7 |

## Did We Buy Anything New?

When we kicked off the year, we defined our boundaries:

_Used, refurbished, reclaimed, are all fair game, but “new” is to be avoided wherever possible._

_Food and household consumable items (baking soda & vinegar for cleaning, soap, art supplies, etc.) are allowed new for obvious reasons._

_Other than this, we only have a short list of exceptions we allow:_

- _Underwear_
- _Socks and shoes_
- _Photo prints (school pictures and for our road trip map)_
- _Stainless steel baking sheet (though we’ll look for used options if we can find them)_
- _Car maintenance parts (we know we need new tires next year)_
- _Home remodeling_

We crashed this month with 25 new items - 10 clothing items, 10 gifts for Christmas, 3 travel car seats for our trip to Hawaii, a corkscrew, and a basket.

I'll forgive us the travel car seats - we went with [MiFold](http://amzn.to/2DqL9H1){: target="_blank"} seats, which end up being as cheap as renting seats from the car rental company and give us a great option to use at home and when the kids need to ride in a relative's car.

## How Did We Do Through the Year?

All told, we bought ___90 new items in 2017___.

I've got mixed feelings about the result. I think this chart speaks volumes:

![Chart showing how many new items purchased in each month - very few in first 6 months, oodles in last 6 months]({{site.url}}/assets/img/posts/2018-01-02-nothing-new-year-wrap-up/nny-chart.png)

We had a lot of resolve, but TK

Through eleven months of the year, we've purchased _sixty-five_ things new that weren't on the exception list. We're far from hitting our goal of zero, but we've purchased __less than half of the new items we did last year__: from January through November of last year, we had purchased 132 new items!

## One Month to Go

If I'm honest, I'm excited for this challenge to be over :)

This challenge has been ambitious and tough. It's had a huge impact on our behavior, but it's humbling to write a post most months that's titled "Nothing New Year" but contains a list of the new things we bought.

That said, this challenge has helped us be a _lot_ better about buying less and buying used.

We don't have a list of new items were anxiously waiting to buy come January and I think we've gotten pretty comfortable buying things used - so long as we leave ourselves the time to search through the options.

These posts have been about our nothing new year challenge, but even more, they've been spending reports. My hope is that these reports provide you with a reference point of another family trying to align their finances with their values.

With all this in mind, I've got a question for you:

___Should I continue to publish spending reports once the Nothing New Year challenge is over? Have you found our spending breakdowns interesting and/or useful?___
