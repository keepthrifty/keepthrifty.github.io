Late last year, I put up a fairly innocent post on social media about how I was looking forward to figuring out what our tax refund was going to be in 2018.

This was followed quickly by a response criticizing my "bad financial move", especially given that I'm a personal finance blogger. Thankfully, the exchange ended before any demands that I turn in my _PF blogger card._

My big mistake? Finance writers often equate a tax refund to giving the government an interest-free-loan. The implication is that money _experts_ would never do something so foolish; the experts optimize every penny, right?

I'll admit, the response really got under my skin (just ask Jaime). It wasn't the money side that bothered me though. I'm comfortable with getting a refund - which I'll explain later in the post.

What got to me was the shaming tone, indicating that if I was getting a refund that I must be __bad with money.__ And if I'm bad with money, I certainly shouldn't be writing a blog that other people look at for what to do with theirs.

I'm sure you've gone through something similar in your life - where the way you live your life becomes a target of criticism.

Here's why you shouldn't let anyone money-shame you (me included), and the foundation you can stand on to be confident in your approach.

## Find Pride in Progress

Everyone's at a different stage in their financial journey. And the most important part of your journey is to keep putting one foot in front of the other.

So, let's take pride in the progress we've made.

When Jaime and I first started our careers, we weren't very diligent savers. We spent a lot of time and money getting ice cream and renting movies. But when our tax refunds came, the size of those checks made them feel like something special - something that should be treated differently.

That often led to us making a prepayment on our mortgage or putting money into emergency savings.

If we had instead gotten that money spread out across our 26 annual paychecks, the pithy difference would have quickly been consumed with lifestyle inflation. One more night of eating out every pay period and that money would have been gone.

Sure, minimizing our withholding and investing the bump in our paycheck could have led to us having even more money. But we weren't financially mature enough to make that kind of move at the time.

What's more, I'd say you could even argue whether getting a refund is sub-optimal. Here's why:

## You'll Never Achieve Financial Perfection



prepay vs invest (except when not; worse returns, "ideal scenario")
tax refund vs maximizing paycheck (except when not)

## It's __Personal__ Finance

You have to choose where you want to sit on the risk/reward curve. The more you risk, the higher the possible reward. But with that comes an increased likelihood of losing out.
