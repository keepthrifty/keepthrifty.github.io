Last year, we published regular spending reports as a part of our [Nothing New Year]({% post_url 2017/2017-01-02-happy-nothing-new-year %}). While the Nothing New Year is over, we'll still be publishing monthly spending reports with a few tweaks. Let's get started!

## Personal Update

January was an action-packed month for our family. We:

{: class="image--right" }

- celebrated Jaime's birthday
- spent [two weeks in Hawaii]({% post_url 2018/2018-02-13-aloha-minimalism %})
- dealt with lots of illness (influenza and stomach flu) - and all the issues that come with new insurance
- reflected on the first half of our mini-retirement and [set goals for 2018]({% post_url 2018/2018-02-06-2017-reflections-2018-goals %})
- made the most of Wisconsin winter while missing the Hawaiian sun :)

Overall, we did a pretty good job managing our spending - at least as well as one can while enjoying the paradise of Hawaii :)

Let's dive into the details of our spending.

## Spending Summary

_We track our spending using a little tool I made called [Thrifty](https://thrifty.keepthrifty.com). We've been using it for over 2 years and it's really helped us get a handle on our finances._

_The screenshots you see below are straight out of our account in Thrifty. If you like what you see, head over and start your_ ___[free 75-day trial](https://thrifty.keepthrifty.com)___ _right now!_

In January, we spent a total of __$4,276.91__. Our annual budget from our mini-retirement is $60,000 so any month under $5,000 is a good month in my book!

Here's how we've been trending on our spending:

![January spending: $4276.91; 12-month average spending: $8415.90]({{site.url}}/assets/img/posts/2018-02-20-january-2018-spending/january-2018-trend.png)

Next, let's take a look at the details of how we spent by category:

![2018 spending - reference table below for details]({{site.url}}/assets/img/posts/2018-02-20-january-2018-spending/january-2018-spending.png)

The high level is great, but let's dive into the details. Here's what we spent in each category:

|----+-------+---------------|
| Category | Amount  | Notes |
|:----:+------:+---------------|
| Charity  | $100.00 | We continued our regular contributions to our church and [The Hope Effect](http://hopeeffect.com/){: target="_blank"}, one of our favorite charities. |
| Eating Out | $90.66 | The influenza really messed with everyone's appetites, so we had a bit more eating out than we'd normally like as we recovered from that. |
| Entertainment | $1.58 | Aside from one Redbox rental, we got all of our movies and books from the library this month for free! |
| Gifts & Celebrations | $89.11 | The kids redeemed one of their Christmas presents - a trip to the movie theater to see Disney's Coco. Jaime and I also went to Olive Garden for lunch on Jaime's birthday. |
| Groceries | $419.77 | This is definitely lower than normal - because it doesn't include the food we bought when we were in Hawaii. For the 2.5 weeks we were here, we averaged about $200 a week - right on target with our goal. |
| Healthcare | $102.52 | I had the pleasure of getting influenza while in Hawaii. Thanks to the wonders of Tamiflu though, I was only laid up for 2 days. |
| Household Care | $173.53 | Shampoo, contraception, toilet paper, feminine products, band-aids, toothpaste, a travel razor, tissues, replacement toothbrushes, and ziploc bags. |
| Pizza & Movie Night | $38.16 | Our Friday night family tradition continued for the weeks we were home this month. This cost includes two pizza nights. |
| Services | $123.12 | Life insurance for both Chris and Jaime, a haircut for Chris, and fees for freezing both of our credit reports. |
| Shelter | $975.00 | Rent for our 1150 square-foot apartment |
| Thrifty | $45.01 | Hosting fees, email management tool, and source code storage for [Thrifty](https://thrifty.keepthrifty.com) this month. |
| Transportation | $128.20 | With a bit of travel around the holidays, we needed extra gas this month, consuming three full tanks. |
| Travel | $1.762.76 | We spent two weeks in Hawaii! See below for more details |
| Utilities | $355.69 | Internet, gas/electric, and water/sewer. |

| __Total__ | __$4,276.91__ | Total without Travel: $2,514.15 |

## Spending Deep Dive: Travel

Here's how our travel spending has trended over time:

![January 2018: $1762.76; 12-month Average: $1178.23]({{site.url}}/assets/img/posts/2018-02-20-january-2018-spending/january-2018-travel-trend.png)

You can tell that travel's a priority to us and we're trying to make it even more so. During our mini-retirement, we're scheduled to take 4 trips:

- a roadtrip of the northeastern USA (done!)
- a 2-week trip to Hawaii (done!)
- a trip to the Carribbean for Jaime and my 10 year anniversary (summer 2018)
- a "Wisconsin Staycation" - visiting the best our state has to offer (summer 2018).

We may also fit in a small spring break road trip this year someplace warm :)

All that adds up, but that's why we try to be so disciplined elsewhere.

### Hawaii Spending Details

![]({{site.url}}/assets/img/posts/2018-02-20-january-2018-spending/hawaii-papa-iloa-beach.jpg)

While in Hawaii, we spent $1,762.76 but our overall trip cost quite a bit more. We booked our flights, [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/c/chrisd5956){: target="_blank" rel="nofollow"}, rental car, and travel insurance back in November and December.

When we add those in, the total cost for our family of five for two weeks was $8,863.08. If you subtract out our normal cost of food for this time period ($500 between groceries, eating out, and pizza/movie night), we averaged a cost of about $1670 per person for our trip.

_Before you ask, no we haven't been travel hacking so we paid for this all out of pocket :)_

In Thrifty, we can look at every individual time we spent - and there were lots. We paid for something 58 times while we were there! If you care to see the details - check below for every penny and every vendor.

There's a few too many there to go into detail on each - we'll just look at one. If you have others you want to hear more about, let us know in the comments!

![Expense at Hanauma Bay - $16.00 for parking and admission]({{site.url}}/assets/img/posts/2018-02-20-january-2018-spending/january-2018-travel-expense.png)

We spent $16.00 on January 19th at the [Hanauma Bay Nature Preserve](https://hanaumabaystatepark.com/). The cost covered parking ($1.00) and admission ($7.50 each for Jaime and I). We got to hang on the beach, build sand castles, and do some snorkeling along the reef. It was one of our favorite stops on Oahu - I definitely recommend it!

Overall the trip was amazing - we had so much quality family time. Knowing how much we spent on each item will help us in the future as we inevitably plan for more trips back to Hawaii. In the ideal, we'd be headed there every January for a break from the Wisconsin cold :)
