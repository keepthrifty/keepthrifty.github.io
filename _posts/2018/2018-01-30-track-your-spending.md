You've got big dreams that you'd like to accomplish in life. Those dreams almost certainly require you to have your money house in order. After all:

If you don't measure your spending, how can you possible manage it?

But managing your spending isn't the only reason to track - the others are even more compelling. Using input from some of my online finance buddies, here are the biggest reasons you'd better be tracking your money:

## 1. To manage what you spend

- Keep from overspending - even once you've "gotten there"
- To make sure I'm not overspending
- To make sure I'm living within my means
- Early warning about "leaks"
- Track against budgeting
- Otherwise I don't know why the money is always gone
- To know exactly where my money is going. In finance, as in every other area in life, knowledge is power

## 2. To reduce what you spend

- Tracking itself reduces Spending
- For utilities, I try to beat the previous month.
- Want to avoid debt, save and invest the difference and build enough wealth to semi-retire early
- Look at each category and ask self how can reduce the numbers
- Visibility into areas of opportunity to maximize net income/savings
- Make it a game to put more towards savings/paying debt

## 3. To build a budget

- Make budgeting easier
- Use to plan budget for next years

## 4. To understand your values - stated AND acted (why you spend)

- make sure everyday actions align with goals, priorities, and dreams
- Help cut down on waste - things that aren't making happy
- Contemplate whether spending aligns with values
- Understand margins, reach life's bigger goals

stated values vs acted values

## 5. To estimate expenses for the future/retirement

- To know what your retirement # is
- Have rock solid understanding of regular spend to accurately estimate future expenses
