1. I won't get bored in retirement
2. We spend a lot for the privilege of working (how our costs have dropped)
3. Mental state is as important as the money (challenges, identity)
4. Old habits die hard (workaholic)
5. But old habits can die (setting up quality time in AM, parameters for day)
6. Freedom is addictive
