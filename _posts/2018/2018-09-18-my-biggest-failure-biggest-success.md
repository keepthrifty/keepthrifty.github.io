Last week, I opened up about [my mental breakdown]({% post_url 2018/2018-09-11-mini-retirement-mental-breakdown %}) from late in my mini-retirement. Recounting the most challenging and painful period in my life has led to some questions that beg an answer:

_Do you regret it?_

_If you could go back, what would you have done differently?_

You may have been wondering the same as you read about where my head was at over the spring and summer. Was the whole mini-retirement a mistake?

## My Biggest Failure

One of my biggest goals in the mini-retirement was to take a chance on entrepreneurship. I'd been wanting to run my own business as long as I can remember. I'd already had some traction on this blog and had built a small but loyal core of users for [Thrifty](https://thrifty.keepthrifty.com). My hope was to turn both of these into an income stream, allowing me to continue the mini-retirement indefinitely.

For roughly 30 years, I'd been dreaming of how amazing it would be to run my own business. But as I got into the details, I discovered so much about entrepreneurship that just wasn't a great fit for me. There were loneliness and isolation. There were uncertainty and rejection. And there was the constant worry that everything was going to fall apart.

To make matters more complicated, I had set strict boundaries about _how_ I wanted to run my business, which hindered my ability to bring in income. By the end of the year, I had only made a small amount of income - from [designing online calculators]({{site.url}}/work-with-us/#calculators-for-your-website) for other personal finance blogs. The income there wasn't incredibly sustainable - there was a ton of effort needed in finding clients and that process was not my forte.

Financially, I hadn't made much progress. I didn't have a "just-around-the-corner" product or service that seemed like it was going to stick. And I had discovered that __selling__ - one of the most important skills every entrepreneur should have - is something I'm really not good at and don't enjoy.

I'd left a good-paying job that provided well for my family, while giving me a great network of co-workers and products I could be excited to help create. And on the other side, I was left with no income and starting from scratch on a job search.

But I don't look at this year as a failure at all. Despite all the heartache and pain, the challenge and struggle, I have no regrets about the leap we took this year. On the contrary - I think this year was one of the most important and successful years of my life.

Here's why:

## My Biggest Success

I had a set of dreams and had created a picture in my head of how I was going to get there and what it looked like. Because that picture was so clear, I felt like it was inevitable that I would find my way through and make it a reality.

Being an entrepreneur meant flexibility - to spend time with my wife and daughters. It meant growth - to push outside my comfort zone, learn new things, and make a difference.

But what I discovered is that, while my vision of how my life was meant to be was flawed, my dreams of a life of love, connection, and growth were within my reach. They just came wrapped in a slightly different package.

By going through the mini-retirement, I was able to find everything I had been looking for; just not where I had been looking.

I had the blessing of having great quality and a great quantity of time with Jaime and the girls. We had amazing times at home and on the road together.

I recognized how fortunate I was in the relationships I had with my co-workers. I worked with a superb group of people and beyond creating great products together, we cared for each other, supported each other, and made each other laugh.

I rediscovered the incredible love and support I had all around me - friends, family, even people I hadn't talked with in years. I have a newfound appreciation for all of the love in my life that I've been blessed with.

I grew as an individual - learning what I wanted out of a career and how I was hoping to make an impact on those around me. I'm getting back to my technical core and loving every minute of it. I'm working with another great team and helping to spread God's word.

I built a stronger faith in God than I've had in my whole life. With what I've gone through, I know I can lean on Him in any situation and that He will care for me. His plans may not always look like mine, but they are for my good and I'm grateful to have His grace and love.

If I hadn't taken the leap, I wouldn't have encountered the challenges that helped me mature, grow, learn and love in the way I have. I'm a better person for the struggles I've encountered. I'm a more mature person, and I'm a happier, more fulfilled person.

Because of what I went through, I'm becoming a better husband, a better father, a better friend, a better engineer, and most importantly, a better child of God.

## Success is How You Choose to Define It

Too often, we view ourselves as failures because we're using the wrong measures of success.

Success isn't a big house, a fancy car, or an overflowing 401k account. Success isn't financial independence, early retirement, or winning the lottery.

Real success is growth - becoming a better version of yourself. Success is learning what's really important in life so you have the confidence to pursue it. Success is seeing the love around you and the opportunities for love you're not taking advantage of.

That kind of success means more. That kind of success is always within your grasp. That kind of success doesn't depend on luck, personality or privilege.

Success is how you choose to define it. Don't conform to the ways of this world - defining success as money, celebrity, or appearance. Find a deeper definition of success - success that comes from growth, learning, and love.
