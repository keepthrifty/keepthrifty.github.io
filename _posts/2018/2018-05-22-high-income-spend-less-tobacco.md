Just for fun, I spent an hour the other day digging through the Bureau of Labor Statistics' [Consumer Expenditure Survey](https://www.bls.gov/cex/tables.htm){: target="_blank"}. I wanted to see if there were any fun things I could learn about how Americans from different backgrounds spend their money.

_Yes, I'm a blast at dinner parties._

While I found a lot of interesting information, most of it was fairly common-sense. People with high incomes save a higher proportion of their income, all while spending more on just about everything. There was only one surprise I ran across.

There was *one* category in the entire set of BLS data that high-income people spent __less__ on - ___tobacco___.

For reference, here's the data I pulled/computed:

|---------------------+------+------|
| Annual Income | Annual Tobacco/Smoking Spend Per Household  | Annual Tobacco/Smoking Spend Per Person |
|:-------------------:+-----:+-----:|
| Less than $15,000   | $297 | $186 |
| $15,000 - $29,999   | $313 | $165 |
| $30,000 - $39,999   | $356 | $155 |
| $40,000 - $49,999   | $371 | $148 |
| $50,000 - $69,999   | $368 | $142 |
| $70,000 - $99,999   | $390 | $134 |
| $100,000 - $149,999 | $376 | $121 |
| $150,000 - $199,999 | $254 |  $82 |
| $200,000 and More   | $204 |  $64 |
|---------------------+------+------|

These numbers can be a bit deceiving though. I don't have any evidence that higher-income smokers consume less tobacco product than lower-income smokers.

Since the table shows the average across _all_ households (including those without tobacco consumption), the most likely reason for the difference is that [fewer high-income people are smokers](https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/campaign/tips/resources/data/cigarette-smoking-in-united-states.html){: target="_blank"}.

We all know that smoking isn't good for your health. To amplify things, it's not good for your finances either. How bad is it?

## How Much Does Tobacco Use Really Cost

![$6.43 per day over 40 years at a 7% growth rate could be worth  $485,000]({{site.url}}/assets/img/posts/2018-05-22-high-income-spend-less-tobacco/future-value-of-money.png)

To keep things simple, we'll ignore incremental healthcare costs and just look at the cost of the product.

Let's say our subject smokes one pack of cigarettes a day at a cost of $6.43 per pack.

Using the MNY [Future Value of Money calculator](https://mny.millennialmoney.com/calculators/future_value_of_money){: target="_blank"}, we can calculate what that daily cost could be worth over the long haul. If the $6.43 a day were invested instead and got a 7% annual growth rate:

- It'd be worth $34,000 after 10 years
- It'd be worth $100,000 after 20 years
- It'd be worth $230,000 after 30 years
- It'd be worth $485,000 after 40 years

That's right - a 40-year smoking habit would be worth nearly half of a million dollars. And that's assuming prices don't go up (which they usually do).

## If You Don't Use Tobacco

A good percentage of you that have made it this far don't have tobacco as a part of your life and are wondering what __you__ can do with any of this information.

I'd challenge you to think about _what habits you do have_ that are costing you on a daily, weekly, monthly basis.

Some of those habits - like a gym membership - might be good for you. But if you dig, maybe you can find an unhealthy habit that's costing you health and money. Here are some ideas:

- Eating out for lunch with coworkers instead of bringing food from home
- Snacks from the vending machine
- Soda habits
- Excessive TV/Movie watching time (with a streaming service)
- High alcohol consumption

For any of these, you can use the MNY [Future Value of Money calculator](https://mny.millennialmoney.com/calculators/future_value_of_money){: target="_blank"} to convert those habits into their dollar value and see what you could be missing out on.

This kind of thinking helped me [give up soda](% post_url 2016/2016-03-14-soda-for-retirement %), switching to coffee instead. Beyond saving a bunch of money, I also feel healthier and happier!
