We're back from our 12-day road trip of the Northeastern US. Over the years, we've come to believe that the road trip is _the best way to travel as a family_ for both the experience and the finances. Let's look at how we make our trips memorable (and manageable). Get ready for an adventure as we explore the Keep Thrifty guide to the best family vacation on a budget: the road trip.

We've used these methods to take our family of five to 46 of the 50 states in the USA over the last 3 years. Through five trips our approximate total cost has been $15000 with a total of 54 days of travel!

There's a lot to pack in, so here's the outline:

## Why Road Trip?

When looking at your options for travel, there's a clear advantage for families to hit the road over taking a flight - on a plane, you pay for every member of your family; other than a _very slight_ increase in gas consumption, getting from A to B in a car costs the same whether you're alone or in a car packed to the brim.

Our family's road tripping obsession started with our first trip in 2014. We needed to get from Wisconsin to Arizona and back for my sister-in-law's wedding. With three kids (aged 3, 2, and 2), we were due to pay for five full-price flights. At the time, that would have been $500 each, totaling $2500. We compared this cost to the cost of our food, gas, hotel stays, and activity costs over the nine days of travel it would take us to get there and back.

In the end, the costs were a wash but we were getting much more _bang for our buck_ by hitting the road. For the same cost as a 4-day vacation with two trips through airports with young ones, we got a 12-day trip at a more leisurely pace that included hitting up national parks, zoos, playgrounds, and seeing parts of the country we had never been to.

{% include tweet-link.html tweet-text="When flying, the focus of a trip is the destination. When road tripping, the focus is the journey." %}

We've found our experiences on the road to be life-changing - giving us the time and empty space to [improve our marriage by dreaming together]({% post_url 2017-07-18-power-of-a-partner %}).

_For the same amount of money, we can have a road trip that's three times as long with a wider array of experiences._

Sold yet? Ok then - let's get into the nitty gritty, starting with the budget.

## Budgeting

Going into any vacation, you should have a budget target in mind. Unless you're in a state where you have more money than you know how to spend, I don't recommend starting planning without setting a constraint for your top-limit budget.

Here's how our five road trips have panned out for costs:

- Wisconsin to Arizona and back
  - __Length:__ 12 days
  - __Cost:__ $3000
  - __Note:__ hotel stays for 3 days of this trip were covered for us as a part of the wedding
- Wisconsin to Gulf Coast, Disney World and back
  - __Length:__ 10 days
  - __Cost:__ $3000
  - __Note:__ this included one full day at Magic Kingdom and Epcot and 3 nights at a Disney resort
- Wisconsin to Pacific Coast of Oregon and back - 12 days - $3500
  - __Length:__ 12 days
  - __Cost:__ $3500
- Wisconsin to Hilton Head Island, South Carolina and back -
  - __Length:__ 8 days
  - __Cost:__ $1500
- Wisconsin to Northeast US and back
  - __Length:__ 12 days
  - __Cost:__ $4000

Start with a preliminary number for your top-limit budget and cut 10% off for "safety margin". Then, as you go through the planning steps below, keep an eye on how things are rolling up so you can adjust to fit within that limit.

Once you've gone on a few trips, you'll get a feel for average expenses for food, hotels, etc for your family and budgeting for future trips should get easier.

Beyond this, please follow this fundamental rule:

_If you don't have the money saved up, don't book the trip._

I can't emphasize this enough. Going into debt for a vacation is a terrible idea. The interest you pay on that trip will make future trips even harder to go on. Just don't do it. If you're feeling constrained, check out the last section of this article for some [creative options for low budgets](#creative-options-for-low-budgets).

## Planning Your Trip

Once you've got your budget set, you can start planning out your trip.

As you go through these options, you may find yourself in a position where you have to scrap your plan and start over (either due to budget constraints, missing a major attraction you want to see, etc).

Don't get bummed out if you get here - we've had to re-plan every one of our trips at least once. The second time through will go much faster and you'll have a better idea of how to reverse-engineer a trip that works for you.

### Picking Your Route

![Map of USA with our routes on each trip. All that's left is California, Nevada, Alaska, and Hawaii]({{site.url}}/img/posts/2017-08-29-best-family-vacation-on-budget-road-trip/road-trip-routes.jpg)

We break our road trips into three segments:
- The departure routes
- The destination
- The return route

We plan on a short stay at a "destination" as a way to break up the trip and give us a piece to anchor around. In the past, this has been my sister-in-law's wedding, a stay at Disney World, and nights at a hotel on or near the beach in Oregon, South Carolina, and Delaware.

One of the best parts of road tripping is experiencing things and places you've never seen before. That's the reason we build our routes as loops - trying to have as little overlap as possible between our departure and return routes.

Typically, one side of the loop is longer than the other. We plan it this way on purpose.

We front-load our trips, putting the longest leg first. After the long trip out and time spent at the destination, most of the family is ready to get home. Saving the shorter leg for last helps us accomplish that with less stress.

### Driving and Daily Schedules

![Man sleeping at the wheel of his car]({{site.url}}/img/posts/2017-08-29-best-family-vacation-on-budget-road-trip/sleep-car.jpg)

The key to an enjoyable road trip is knowing your family's preferences and limits and building the trip around those.

Some questions to consider:

- Do your kids sleep well in the car?
- Do they transfer well from the car to bed?
- Are you comfortable driving in the dark?
- When are you most awake and aware for the safest driving?
- How long can you and your kids reasonably keep yourselves entertained while driving?

In all things, err on the side of caution. Remember - the trip isn't about getting to the destination as fast as possible - it's about enjoying every step. If you drive less each day but have fun along the way, you'll have a much happier trip.

After some reflection, build a template of your rough daily schedule. This will help you determine your stops on the days you don't have something extra special picked out.

Here's an example from our most recent trip:

- Depart at 9 am
- Driving stretch of 2-3 hours
- Stop for lunch and activity (~ 1 hour)
- Driving stretch of 1.5-2.5 hours
- Stop for activity (~ 45 min)
- Driving stretch of 2-3 hours
- Stop for dinner near hotel (~ 1 hour)
- Get to hotel

In total, we target no more than 7.5 hours of driving a day. We learned this the hard way on [our trip to the Pacific Northwest]({% post_url 2016-07-06-roadtrip-recap %}) where we were in the car 8-9 hours each day we were driving. Restless kids and anxious adults make the trip a lot rougher.

Don't feel obligated to follow the schedule _every day_; it's just a guide you can use for some structure. If you find that you need to have a longer driving day one day, shorten the next one. If you plan to spend a day and a half at a national park, figure out what portion of the daily schedule applies.

Finally, here's a quote to keep in mind as you plan your route:

> Thanks to the Interstate Highway System, it is now possible to travel across the country from coast to coast without seeing anything.
> <cite>Charles Kuralt</cite>

We've found that there's a fair amount of truth to this - especially in certain parts of the country. Some of our most memorable stretches of driving have been when we got off the interstate system and took county or state highways instead. In many cases, the route is nearly as fast and _much_ more scenic.

To go a step further, you may even consider searching for "scenic byways" along your route. There are some beautiful stretches of road out there - you just have to find them!

### Where to Stay

![Rusted "Motel" sign]({{site.url}}/img/posts/2017-08-29-best-family-vacation-on-budget-road-trip/motel.jpg)

Where you choose to sleep can have a big impact on your budget. Unless you're picking cockroach-infested motels, this can easily eat up half of your budget or more.

As we plan out our route, hotel stays are one of the things we pick out first. After following the daily schedule, you'll have a sense for how far you can get each day and can pick a few cities to research.

In general, we book refundable stays just in case. While we haven't bailed on a full road trip yet, we have changed plans once or twice while we were on the road. Take note of cancellation timelines for each stay and bring the list (along with phone numbers for each hotel) along just in case.

In terms of picking where to stay, we've tried a number of different strategies with varied success. Here's our experience with each:

#### Cheapest Reasonable Stay

With this approach, you consider any lodging with the right number of beds to be a possibility. In the area you're considering, search Google Maps for hotels and check prices for your date. Then use Trip Advisor to check the reviews for each hotel starting with the lowest priced and working your way up.

Rule out anything that violates your family's must-haves.

We've found that this method can save a ton of money but can also be a big gamble. We stayed in a motel in rural Idaho that we didn't feel comfortable going shoeless in. Much to our chagrin, one of our kids threw a temper tantrum that evening and was rolling around on the floor under the sink in anger. \*cringe\*

Remember - you get what you pay for.

#### One Step Above Cheap

Here, we set the bar a bit higher for our family by defining some "must-haves" that we honestly could live without, but that made our trip a whole lot easier.

First, we only looked at hotels with a hot breakfast. Getting your kids up and excited for the day on the road can be tough, but if they love pancakes and breakfast sausage, these can be powerful motivators. At home, our kids have cold cereal six days a week and pancakes on Saturdays, so this is a special treat.

Second, we insisted that they have cable. This is ironic because we don't even have _an antenna_ in our home - let alone cable. The reason is similar to our rationale for breakfast. Giving our kids the chance to indulge with Disney Junior (and my wife the chance to indulge in HGTV) is a great way to cool down at the end of the day.

Finally, we try to find hotels with a pool whenever possible. While we may not use these at every stay, it's a great option to have when you get to the hotel if the kids are looking to get some energy out.

With all three of these, the key is that each is a way to make _every day a little bit special_. This is a critical theme to road trip success. You don't have to do something grand or amazing every day for that day to be special - celebrating the little things that are different from your routine at home is a great way to go.

#### Single Chain

Most recently, we set a new bar for ourselves - picking a single hotel chain and booking exclusively there. This allows us to take the best advantage of rewards programs and gives everyone consistent expectations. You wouldn't believe the tantrums we've experienced when one of the kids was expecting pancakes but all the hotel had was waffles :)

The rewards program point is an important one here. We convert our hotel points to miles for our airline rewards program. By the end of our latest road trip, we were earning an extra 10% for our miles from each stay and received extended checkout and priority check-in. These aren't life-changing, but are certainly nice-to-have.

### What to Do - Keeping it Fun and Frugal

If you insist on covering every touristy attraction while you're on the road, you're bound to break your budget and your timeline. Here are some great options for free or frugal activities for the whole family.

#### Zoos

![Kids looking at prairie dogs at the David Traylor Zoo]({{site.url}}/img/posts/2017-08-29-best-family-vacation-on-budget-road-trip/david-traylor-zoo.jpg)

There are a large number of [___free zoos___ throughout the US](http://frugalupside.blogspot.com/2012/03/free-zoos-in-united-states.html) and every one we've been able to visit has been pretty amazing. We have one here in Madison, Wisconsin (the [Henry Vilas Zoo](http://www.vilaszoo.org/)) and one of our favorites was in Emporia, Kansas (the [David Traylor Zoo](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g38694-d3152319-Reviews-David_Traylor_Zoo_of_Emporia-Emporia_Kansas.html)).

If you've got a membership to a zoo in your area, you can also look on your zoo's website to see if they offer "reciprocity" on admission fees to other zoos around the country. In many cases, you can get free admission or 50% off of zoos you're not a member of if you look ahead of time.

#### Museums

Similar to zoos, there are also lots of [free museums](http://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/free-to-see/museums-us/) you can check out. The same concept of reciprocity applies here as well - if you have a family membership to your local children's museum, you might find that you can get in free or cheap at other ones around the country.

Beyond the list at the link above, search the cities you're passing through for "free museum" and you may be surprised at what you find!

#### Playgrounds

![Girl running toward playground]({{site.url}}/img/posts/2017-08-29-best-family-vacation-on-budget-road-trip/playground.jpg)

Especially when your kids are younger, this is an __awesome__ staple to put into your road trip activity plan. With a bit of google searching, you can usually find _amazing_ playgrounds for your kids to stop at regardless of the state you're in.

Most of the playgrounds we've spent time at have far exceeded the quality of options near our house. Add in the "new" factor, and your kids will look forward to these stops no matter how many you have on your trip.

In medium or large cities, a quick search of "best playgrounds in <location>" will often give you insight into spots that the locals love and that your family probably will too!

#### Libraries

For some free _indoor_ fun, consider finding local libraries. Beyond taking a few minutes to relax and read, libraries often have play areas and computers with games for the kids to enjoy.

#### Hiking

![Hiking near Kootenai Falls]({{site.url}}/img/posts/2017-08-29-best-family-vacation-on-budget-road-trip/hiking-kootenai-falls.jpg)

Ahhh...hiking. It's about the simplest free activity you can do, but it also can be incredibly rewarding - especially when you're traveling the country, seeing new geography your family has never experienced. We've found amazing hikes all over the country - you can search by state, county, or city and you're bound to find at least an option or two. If you're going to go this route, be sure to bring bug spray and remember to check for ticks (and other critters) after you're done.

#### National/State/County/City Parks:

If your route takes you near [National Parks](https://www.nps.gov/hfc/cfm/carto.cfm), which it almost certainly does, consider opting in for an annual pass and get access to all the parks for the next year. At $80, it's a steal for the amazing areas you'll get access to.

#### Other Options

![Biggest live oak outside Gainesville, FL]({{site.url}}/img/posts/2017-08-29-best-family-vacation-on-budget-road-trip/biggest-live-oak.jpg)

Sometimes, despite your best efforts, you'll be out of luck on finding a fun-looking stop in the categories above. In that case, Trip Advisor is your best friend. We found the "Biggest Live Oak Tree" outside of Gainesville, Florida through a Trip Advisor search in the area. It turned out to be an awesome experience - we got some great pictures and saw a tortoise walking through the field.

If all else fails, consider tweaking your trip a bit (drive a little shorter or a little longer) to give you a new area to search.

#### Worthwhile Extras

![Hiking in Flume Gorge]({{site.url}}/img/posts/2017-08-29-best-family-vacation-on-budget-road-trip/hiking-flume-gorge.jpg)

While free and frugal activities are awesome, there are some things that are just worth paying for.

As one example, we paid $45 for admission to [hike Flume Gorge](https://www.nhstateparks.org/visit/state-parks/flume-gorge.aspx)  in New Hampshire (pictured above) but it was worth every penny. We paid $60 to park next to Central Park in New York City for a day and I wouldn't change it.

It's ok to splurge on some experiences, but don't overdo it. If you have one of these every few days, you can stay within budget. If you go every day, you'll bust your budget and you'll probably be exhausted too - the paid activities tend to be a lot busier than the free ones.

### Eating

![Picnic on a play structure]({{site.url}}/img/posts/2017-08-29-best-family-vacation-on-budget-road-trip/picnic-lunch.jpg)

Not surprisingly, the advice for keeping your food bill frugal on a road trip sounds the same as you'd hear at home:

_Make your own meals. Avoid eating out and treats._

That may be oversimplifying though, so let's take a look meal-by-meal:

#### Breakfast

If you followed my advice on staying at a hotel with breakfast provided, you're good to go here. Every morning can start with hot coffee and a nice meal without worrying about the cost. Bonus - you can often pack these and eat on the road if you need. We've been known to stash some bagels and cream cheese and have a mid-morning brunch at an early first stop.

#### Lunch

Making your own lunches on the road can be easy, healthy, and kind to your budget. We focus on minimizing foods that need refrigeration by doing peanut butter sandwiches as our primary lunch staple. Throw in some fruit and you've got a "good-enough" lunch. In addition, leftovers from the previous day's dinner are great for your picky eaters.

Build in a short grocery store trip every 2-3 days of your trip so you can re-stock.

Pack a sharp knife, a small bottle of dish soap, and a rag so you can cut fruit for yourself at your hotel. No need to pay those ridiculous markups for pre-cut fruit.

We bring a small cooler bag to keep fruit or other items cool during the day and pack with reusable ice packs (that we re-freeze every night in the hotel mini-fridge).

We pair our lunches with an outdoor activity stop. Most playground spaces have picnic tables. If not, sometime's we'll even eat on the playground equipment itself!

#### Dinner

As a matter of convenience (and as a part of making the trip special), we eat out for every dinner. That said, we're not going over-the-top.

Target restaurants that are quick and can get a full family of five fed for $40 or less, after tax. Based on our kids' ages, we _only_ choose restaurants that have a kids menu.

Beyond the "fast-casual" chains, you can usually find good success with a couple different options:

__Pizza__ - getting pizza from the local pizza place is a great way to experience how pies are made in different parts of the country. Skip delivery and pick it up after your spouse and kids have checked into the hotel. You can save a few bucks and everyone can enjoy eating in a quiet, comfortable space

__Mexican restaurants__ - often servings are al a carte, meaning you can scale your meal to what you're actually hungry for. No need to get that fourth taco if you're not going to eat it.

One final piece of advice here - this is a great area of your trip to get your kids' help in planning. Find a few options in the area and let one of your kids pick the joint. They'll be excited to be a part of the process and will eat like champs when they're there.

#### Snacks and Treats

As a parent, one of my biggest pet peeves is uneaten food - especially food that I paid for :)

We've shifted to avoiding snacks during our drive time - encouraging the kids to eat all their food at meal time. This saves us from messes in the car as well as keeps my frustration level low when we're out for dinner.

We typically use one treat a day as an incentive for good behavior on the trip. Missing out on ice cream is a mistake most kids will only make once per trip.

#### Water

It's important to keep hydrated no matter where you are, but even more so on the road. Avoid wasting money on water by getting reusable water bottles (preferably metal or rubber-coated glass) that you can fill during your stops. You can fill these before you check out in the morning and refill as necessary at rest stops, playground drinking fountains, and restaurants.

Don't get sucked into the expensive habit of buying $2 water bottles from the gas station.

### Packing

![Clothes packed in an organizing bag, jeans and a sweatshirt nearby]({{site.url}}/img/posts/2017-08-29-best-family-vacation-on-budget-road-trip/packing-clothes.jpg)

Just because your minivan has a ton of storage space doesn't mean you need to fill it on your trip. Knowing that we're [minimalists]({{site.url}}/archive/#minimalism), you should expect that we apply a lot of the same principles on our road trips.

By packing light, we minimize the number of things we need to haul, the number of things we need to take care of, and the number of things we can lose. All of this minimizes our stress.

With a few tweaks to your mentality and the right tools, you can avoid those awkward suitcase carts at the hotel and zip up to your room without an issue.

#### Tactic 1: Plan for Laundry

We'd likely get hernias trying to haul around suitcases with twelve days worth of clothes on our trips. Instead, we pack enough clothes to cover 3-4 days of warm weather and a pair of pants and a sweatshirt in case we encounter any cold days. We plan to do laundry every 2-3 days on the trip - at our hotel (as planned above). While this takes time, it's usually something that can be done in the evening without much hassle while cuddling up and watching a movie together as a family.

This saves us from so much extra hassle and cuts the number of bags we need to handle by 75%.

Most hotel laundry machines are coin-operated, so make sure to pack quarters or have cash on-hand to get change at the hotel.

#### Tactic 2: Use Organizing Bags

If you haven't used organizing bags to pack, you've been missing out. Before our first trip, my wife bought some [bags from Eagle Creek](http://shop.eaglecreek.com/packing-organizers-view-all/l/330) and we use them to this day. Each family member gets one bag and all clothes must fit. Because the bags compress the clothes tightly (and we roll our clothes to save space as well), you can easily fit 3-4 days worth of clothing in a really small space.

We use one bag per family member. You can see what we packed for me on our latest trip in the picture above.

#### Tactic 3: Everyone Gets a Backpack

By giving everyone a single backpack with their own clothing and items in it, you can have everyone chip in on getting their stuff up and back from the hotel room.

The kids are responsible for their own packs, which contain their clothes, tablets, blankets, and any toys or stuffed animals they want to bring on the trip. We didn't do this until our kids were a bit older, but now that they are all 5+, this is an absolute Godsend.

#### Tactic 4: Toiletries Bag

![Toiletries bag containing everything from toothbrushes to deodorant]({{site.url}}/img/posts/2017-08-29-best-family-vacation-on-budget-road-trip/toiletries-bag.jpg)

Similar to the organizing bags, we purchased a toiletries bag that not only serves a purpose on our trips - we actually use it day-to-day at home.

#### Tactic 5: If You Don't Need It, Leave It (in the car)

Think before you haul everything upstairs.

As an example, we usually have a laundry basket we bring along full of towels and swimming gear. If we're not using the pool that night, why waste the energy hauling it upstairs.

If we change our minds later, I can always run back down and grab it.

#### Tactic 6: If You Don't Need It, Leave It (at home)

Consider whether you _really_ need each item you're bringing along. I used to bring my razor along on the trip, but quickly realized that I could leave it home if I just shaved the day before we left and felt comfortable sporting a bit of a beard throughout the trip (spoiler: I most certainly am).

### The Ever-Important Binder

This is the last big piece of preparation but possibly the most important - the info binder.

Before your trip, look up directions for each stop and print them out; organize these into a three-ring binder with dividers for each day of travel. You should also print any hotel confirmations or other reservations you've made and put them here as well.  

Finally, get a sleeve that can go in the binder to hold any receipts so you can [track your spending]({{site.url}}/thrifty/) for the trip. Doing so will help you plan your budget for future trips.

We also usually check out a copy of the latest road atlas from our library system for our trip just in case. Google's directions are great for getting you in the area, but you never know what may happen. If you're lost in the middle of nowhere without a cell signal, having an old-fashioned map is a big help!

## During the Trip

Awesome job - your bags are packed, the gas tank is full and everyone's ready to get on the road! Now it's time for some thoughts about what you'll encounter on your journey.

### Car Activities

Spending 7-8 hours crammed in a metal box with four other people can sound more like the plot for a horror movie than an exciting family vacation. Handled properly, however, these hours can be some of the most fun of your trip.

Ideas for keeping entertained while in the car include:

- Audiobooks that the family can enjoy (especially if you can rent them from the library)
- The [Alphabet Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet_Game)
- Hum songs and have everyone else guess what the song is
- [Car Bingo](http://www.momsminivan.com/printables.html)
- License plate game (finding license plates from as many states as possible)
- Celebrating each time you cross into a new state
- Talking. I'm not joking :) How often do you get time that you can seriously sit and focus on having a conversation with your family members?
- Books, coloring, and toys - lots of items from home can travel well enough in the car. The time on the road gives your kids great time to work on their imagination.
- And, of course, __screen time__. This one's big enough that it deserves its own section. Read on.

### Screen Time

For our road trips, we bought a Kindle Fire tablet for each of our kids and loaded them with free games and a few purchased movies and TV shows. That said, we don't want our kids to spend our entire drive time staring at their screens.

With that in mind, here are two rules to consider for screen time:

- Designate times during the day where tablets/phones/computers/etc will be either "absolutely available", "absolutely unavailable", and "negotiable based on behavior". We use these, in order, for our morning stretch, our post-lunch stretch, and our last leg of the day.
- Once batteries die, the screens stay off until the next morning. We charge tablets every night, but have stopped trying to work out charging in the car. Invariably you'll end up with one more dead device than however many portable chargers you brought with anyway.

In addition, headphones (with volume limiters) are highly encouraged to help Mom and Dad have some amount of quiet time during the day.

### Capturing Memories

![Posterboard with US States outlines. States we've visited are filled in with pictures from that portion of our trip]({{site.url}}/img/posts/2017-08-29-best-family-vacation-on-budget-road-trip/usa-road-trip-map.jpg)

We originally planned to minimize our costs of souvenirs by just buying one for each road trip, but now we've done one better. My wife came up with the idea for a memory map, where we fill in the states we've visited with pictures from each road trip as we get there. The image above doesn't have the pictures from our two most recent trips in yet, but I expect we'll get them put together in the next few months.

To take advantage of this, make sure to take lots of pictures on your trip. In particular, focus on pictures of your family (candid shots are my favorite) instead of just the scenery. It's the moments you experience together that you'll really appreciate.

### Unexpected Changes

Despite all of your best plans, you are bound to have some hiccups along the way. We've suffered three-hour detours, a foggy day at Mount Rushmore, and having three kids with walking pneumonia on our travels.

The key here is to remember that you're not in control and that's ok. Make the best of the situation and soldier on. If there's rain for your lunch stop, eat in the car. If one of the kids is really sick, breeze through your other stops and get to the hotel so they can get some rest. If your kids are all sleeping when you're due to take an afternoon break, it's ok to keep driving and enjoy the quiet :)

## When You Get Home

The keys to having a great road trip don't stop while you're still on the road. Here are a couple critical things to keep in mind once you get home:

- Plan to take 1-2 days off after your trip to recover and get back into your normal routine. We often plan to get back home on a Friday so we'll have the weekend to recover before Monday hits.
- While you'll all likely be happy to be home, expect that your kids (and you for that matter) may take some time to re-adjust.

## Creative Options For Low Budgets

So, not every trip is going to fit neatly into these buckets. Maybe your budget is a bit tighter or you're just looking for something different. Here are three ideas to help your budget while keeping the road trip spirit alive:

- Mix in Camping - For those that are outdoorsy, this can be a great way to cut costs - camp sites are significantly cheaper than hotel stays. Make sure to book extra time in your day for tent set-up and tear-down as well as space in your car to pack all the extra gear.
- Friends and Family Tour - if you've got friends and family around the country, make them a part of your trip! Ask if you can stay the night - you'll get to build them into your road trip experience and build your relationships as well.
- The Ultimate Staycation - if you're looking to keep your budget super-low, this is a great way to go. Plan a "road trip" where you end every night at your home. Build driving loops for _each day_, exploring the awesome things to do in your area. Once you start searching, you'll be surprised at all the cool things you can find to do in your own state. We're planning on doing this next summer as we work on saving up for our trips to Alaska, Hawaii, California, and Nevada.

## Closing

Well, if it wasn't obvious before, it should be now: we love road tripping. There's certainly work to be done in the planning process, but planning out an awesome trip is one of the big parts of what makes road trips fun. If you're looking for the best family vacation on a budget, road tripping is the way to go.

When you do hit the road, keep thrifty and keep safe!

_That's our approach to having the best family vacation on a budget. It's worked fairly well for us over the years and we've got the memories to prove it :) What tips do you have for traveling as a family on a budget?_
