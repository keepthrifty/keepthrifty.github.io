As we get closer to our transition from our _big house_ to our _small apartment_, an unsettling thought has crossed my mind a few times. With my current income, we're able to quite comfortably afford the house we're in. Selling our house and [moving into an even more affordable apartment]({% post_url 2017-05-15-big-barriers-living-smaller %}) is great for us - but what about the other couples and families that looked at our apartment?

When we toured the apartment, we were sandwiched between two other potential tenants. I don't presume to know their economic situation, but I'm guessing that we're outliers here. _Most people in our area wouldn't consider cramming a family of five into a two-bedroom apartment if they could afford something bigger._

We have a fairly high credit score and demonstrable income to pay our rent without issue. While the landlord didn't communicate whether this was a part of their decision to choose us as tenants, I'd imagine it was a factor.

_What if there's another five-person family that missed out on this apartment because we got it instead?_ Our schools are highly ranked and the number of available rentals is typically small. Lots of non-homeowner parents try to rent in our suburb so they can have their kids in these schools, but the competition is high.

Let's take a look at this through the wonderful world of smileys.

## If We Live Smaller at the Expense of Others

<div class="image-caption">Look at that smug jerk on the left...</div>

If we choose to pursue smaller living at the _expense_ of a (potentially) lower-income family, they wouldn't have the opportunity to live in our community.

We'd be happy because we would be living out our dream and spending significantly less.

The landlords might have a bit tougher time renting out their bigger apartments because one less family (us) would be looking. They might even have to drop the price a bit to get them rented.

_Man, this really is starting to look like a selfish choice._

## If We Live Bigger Because of Guilt

If we choose not to pursue smaller living so that someone else with less income could, it'd certainly be better for them.

We'd be unhappy because we'd be missing out on a chance to live in our values.

And the landlords? They'd be happy - because they got to rent out the small apartment, as well as a bigger apartment to us.

This option is better for everyone other than us. But man, should we really be that self-sacrificing?

## Your Dollars Have Power

So, should we have just stayed in our bigger house, or at least rented a bigger, more expensive apartment?

___Of course not.___

Falling into that line of thinking is a losing attitude that assumes we are powerless to impact the world around us. The best situation for our community would sufficient housing so that we can live small ___and___ the other family can find an apartment at a reasonable cost as well.

This is one of those situations where we, in a small way, can actually be a part of changing the world around us. Here's how:

By pursuing living smaller, we're sending a message to the landlords and developers out there on what we want. If a landlord sees a really high interest in a certain type of apartments, they are going to do two things:

1. Raise the price in the short term
2. Work to buy and rent more of those apartments in the long-term (which brings the price back down)

_By pursuing what we want, we can actually change the landscape of what's available._

That's the economics of supply and demand in one little lesson.

There's no reason we should feel stuck living bigger if it doesn't align with our values. By pushing to live smaller, we can create a community where living smaller is possible for more people.

## If We Live Smaller (the long-term picture)

In the long-term picture, the smileys look a lot better for the situation where we choose to live smaller.

By pushing hard for living smaller, we increase the demand for two-bedroom apartments in our community. Landlords will work with developers to make more two-bedroom apartments available here. As a result, we'll get to live in one and lots of other families will too.

We're happy because we're living out our values and spending less.

The other family is happy because they get access to our community.

The landlords are happy because, well, they're making money :)

## Keep Thrifty and Carry On

It can be easy to get caught up in dangerous lines of thinking when you're making big life changes. You're going to get enough pressure from the outside already - don't add to it by questioning yourself internally.

_Have you ever felt guilty or selfish for spending less? What was the scenario? Did feeling that way change your behavior?_
