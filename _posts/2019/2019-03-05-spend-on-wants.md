If you read enough personal finance articles, you're bound to eventually come across a recurring theme about the importance of distinguishing your wants from your needs. 

that which matters most must never come at the expense of that which matters least

value-based wants vs frivolous wants

our examples - spending plan for 2019; compare to old (2015, 2016) actual spending.

This is the core of personal finance:
- Cover your needs
- Minimize your frivolous wants
- Maximize your value-based wants

Those wants may be early retirement, travel, charity, or buying pokemon cards. I'm not here to tell you what to spend on, because that's based on your values.

When it comes to doing this, understanding is power - you need to understand *what* your needs are to make sure you've got them covered. Then you need to understand what frivolous wants are a part of your life so you can eliminate them. And then you need to identify what your value-based wants are so you can redirect your focus.

Having fewer pieces of pottery barn furniture means we can give and travel - and that's awesome for us.

Eating out less means we can prepay our mortgage and save for retirement - and that's awesome for us.
