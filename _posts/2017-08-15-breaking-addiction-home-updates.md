__$28,500__. That's how much we spent on updates and maintenance in the last two years we lived in our house. We were remodeling mostly with the intent to sell and had pared down our list of preferred updates to ensure we could sell on an earlier timeline. As my wife and I considered this number and the projects we didn't pursue, we realized that we likely would have spent tens of thousands more if we had stayed in our house. It's worth taking a look at _why_ this is, and what we can do to save ourselves if we ever get back into home ownership.

## Our Hedonic Treadmill

We left our house in a state with a few obvious projects - replacing the carpeting,  installing a dishwasher, replacing the kitchen appliances and water heater, fixing up the landscaping - but in the back of our heads, we always had a list much longer than that.

If we had chosen to stay in our house for the next 20 years, we would have done a whole lot more:

- Redo the railing around our porch - 20-year-old worn plastic has lost it's appeal
- Scrape the popcorn texture off all the ceilings, repaint
- Replace our open deck with a screened-in deck. Buggy Wisconsin summers are a lot nicer when they can't get to you
- Finish the walls on the interior of the garage, install better storage solutions and shelving
- Build a pergola over the stamped concrete patio to create a shaded outdoor space
- Replace fiberglass tub/shower in the master bathroom with a tiled shower and glass door
- Move the washer and dryer out of the basement, up to the same floor as the bedrooms
- Replace the roof - maybe a nice metal one or [some cool Tesla solar shingles](https://www.tesla.com/solarroof){: target="_blank"}?

Our discussions about future home updates were like a financial version of "[The Song That Doesn't End](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0U2zJOryHKQ){: target="_blank"}". We'd get to the end of the list and then think of one more thing...and then another...and then another.

Every one of these would have increased the value of our home and made it look more like something out of a design magazine, but at the same time, they would have seriously interfered with our ability to [pursue other dreams]({% post_url 2017-07-11-one-year-mini-retirement %}).

## Getting Off the Treadmill

Over the last several years, we've cut our spending on groceries, clothing, furniture, transportation, gifts, and even utilities.

Home updates, on the other hand, was always a tougher challenge. After all, this was our _home_. This was the place we were raising our family and were going to spend our life in.

But the core question should have been the same as it is in the trade-offs with any expense.

_Is spending money on this more important than the other goals I've got?_

With home updates, this was true to a point. We used our home as a canvas for my wife to express her creativity and design skills. Pursuing these updates brought her vision to life and something like that is absolutely worth it.

But we would have reached (or maybe did already reach) a point of diminishing returns.

Fortunately for us, our [desire to downsize]({% post_url 2017-04-10-living-in-half-of-our-house %}) became one of our biggest goals, which led us to selling our house and renting an apartment instead.

As we changed our environment, we suddenly had a new constraint.

As renters, not owners, we literally _cannot_ update our apartment. Sure, we can get a few pieces of furniture, but we aren't allowed to paint the walls, update the trim, install recessed lighting, take down walls, or anything else. Now we have to learn to find contentment in our current space.

Surprisingly, it's been easier than we thought.

- This tells us that we weren't pursuing what we actually needed. We were trying to turn our old house into the home we wanted, but it wasn't ever going to be that - it was bigger than we needed and didn't fit the lifestyle we wanted. No amount of updates was going to change that.

- Finding contentment in our current space is a great skill that will enable us for the future

- If we move into home ownership again, how will it be different?
- We'll be picking a home that's the right size.
- We'll be going in with a finite list of ideas for what we'd want to do (if anything) with the place
- We'll have seen the fruits of our labor in living out other dreams and be more cognizant of the expensive tradeoff of updates when compared to those.
