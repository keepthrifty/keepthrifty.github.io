Tomorrow is a special day in the Keep Thrifty household - it's our 9-year wedding anniversary. When we got married, I was excited to spend the rest of our lives together, but I honestly didn't grasp the full power of having a partner in my life. Our marriage has had plenty of ups and downs but in the last two years I feel we've really started to figure this whole thing out.

## Early Failings

When my wife and I first started dating, we quickly bonded over shared values. We both were incredibly close with our families. We were both excited to be parents someday and to make that a core focus in our lives. We both grew up with entrepreneur parents and had aspirations of running our own businesses.

We had a solid foundation based on our values and quickly fell in love. After two years we got engaged; another year and a half and we were married.

We were both excited for the years ahead but by this time, our focus had already started shifting. We used to make carefree time for each other and spent our time dreaming of the future but now our careers, possessions, and personal goals had taken the spotlight.

I started classes for my MBA just over a month after our honeymoon. I invested countless hours into business articles, video games, and other distractions. Even though I was working a full-time job and taking a full load of classes for graduate school, I invested free time in my coding skills instead of our marriage.

My wife invested her energy into her work and in turning our house into a home with new furniture and decorations. We started a family and my wife pursued her dream of starting a business while being a stay-at-home mom.

We were pursuing our dreams, but we didn't feel like a team. If anything, our goals felt like they were in competition with each other. Whenever I brought up the concept of starting my own business, my wife felt like I wasn't making our financial security and time as a family a priority. I felt like I wasn't being allowed to fulfill my aspirations.

Things were rough and there didn't seem to be a way they could get better.

## Inflection Point

In 2014, we found out that my sister-in-law would be getting married in Arizona. With three kids (ages 3, 2, and 2), that either meant a stressful flight and 5 full-price plane tickets or a multi-day road trip. We decided to hit the road and planned out our trip.

As we put together the pieces, my wife and I found ourselves working together - building a vision for what the trip could look like and trying to balance the needs of every member of our family. For the first time in years, we felt like we were working together to create something we were both excited for.

Finally, in June, we hit the road and it was __magical__.

My wife and I had countless hours on the road to talk, laugh, and experience new adventures. We felt more connected than we had in years.

As we drove, we talked about our travels as individuals - counting how many states each of us had been to. We flipped through the road atlas and found places we'd love to visit. Finally, we asked a simple question: "How cool would it be if we could visit all 50 states with our girls before they graduate high school?".

Thus, a shared dream was born.

## Bringing it Home

When we got home, we couldn't wait to plan the next trip. Even though we wouldn't leave for another year, we started looking at our stops right away.

As we built our plans for future trips, we opened up to each other about our other hopes and dreams.

My wife wanted to remodel our house. She's got incredible creativity and a unique ability to see a space for what it _can be_. Years ago, I would have only looked at this as a financial burden, but now I looked at it as my wife chasing her dreams - something I truly wanted to support.

I wanted to work on my coding - to develop and launch an app. Years ago, my wife would have looked at this as taking time away from our family. Now, she looked at it as me chasing my dreams - something she truly wanted to support.

Our mindset shifted from pursuing our own interests to supporting each other's. Even better, we started to see the bigger, shared goals that we could accomplish together.

We spent more time being truly present with each other, we talked more, and most importantly, we dreamed more.

### The Secret to A Successful Marriage

One of my favorite bloggers, Mr. Groovy, recently published a great article - [The Groovy Guide to Having a Great Marriage](http://freedomisgroovy.com/the-groovy-guide-to-having-a-great-marriage/){: target="_blank"}. In it, he describes 10 things to do to make sure you and your spouse become the ultimate team.

I loved suggestions and have one more - which I view as the secret to a successful marriage: ___Dream together___

## The True Power of Partnership

![Braided rope tied in shape of a heart]({{site.url}}/img/posts/2017-07-18-power-of-a-partner/rope-heart.jpg)

Before we met, my wife and I had each considered studying abroad in Australia during college. I got tripped up by the big picture - _it'd be expensive and way outside my comfort zone - what if it isn't worth it?_ My wife got tripped up by the logistics - _this paperwork is crazy - how do I know I've got everything taken care of_?

Neither of us actually went. Alone, we couldn't be successful.

The power in marriage comes from how we were created - as individuals with different strengths and weaknesses. As a couple, your partner can be strong where you are weak and vice versa.

My wife has an ability to see things for what they can be - a blank piece of paper can become a beautiful work of art. A jumbled set of rooms can become a friendly, open family space. When it comes time to make leaps, she's got the courage to see that it's worth it. I on the other hand, have an ability to grind through, research, and figure out logistics.

Alone, we had dreams but were each missing pieces to make them a reality. Together, we're a completed puzzle. Throw God in the mix and we're almost unstoppable.

> Though one may be overpowered, two can defend themselves. A cord of three strands is not quickly broken.

## Find Your Partner - Find Your Power

If you haven't found your partner yet, look for someone who shares your values. It's ok - even good - if they are different from you in other ways, but shared values are important. Start your relationship dreaming together and __never stop.__

If you've got a partner, find your shared values. Look for areas of conflict and recognize that there's an opportunity to see your partner's strengths buried in there. Find how you complement each other and dream together.

### Rough Times

You might be in a relationship where things aren't going well. We've been there. Our marriage has had some _really_ rough spots. But remember that the things you're going through now don't define your whole relationship. You chose to be together for a reason and with the right focus, you can dream again, work together, and experience the true power of a partner.

A great marriage takes work but it's worth it!

I feel incredibly blessed to have such an amazing partner in life - my wife Jaime. I'm truly a better man because of you and I'm so excited for the life we have ahead. Let's keep dreaming :)
