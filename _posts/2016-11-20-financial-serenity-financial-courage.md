Life and finances are full of uncertainty. Crises beyond your control can strike at any time - market crashes, medical emergencies, natural disasters, job losses. How can you keep your chin up and weather the storm? The answer includes two concepts on opposite ends of the same spectrum - Financial Serenity and Financial Courage.

## The Serenity Prayer

You may be familiar with the "Serenity Prayer":

> God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,
>
> Courage to change the things I can,
>
> And wisdom to know the difference.

This adaptation of the prayer has been adopted by a number of 12-step programs to help individuals suffering from addictions, but it really can apply to your everyday life - even your finances.

## Financial Serenity

> Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.
> <cite>Victor Frankl</cite>

As much as we'd like to pretend we're in the driver's seat, much of what happens on a daily basis is beyond our control.

## Financial Courage

> Dilligence is the mother of good luck
> <cite>Benjamin Franklin</cite>

## Financial Wisdom
