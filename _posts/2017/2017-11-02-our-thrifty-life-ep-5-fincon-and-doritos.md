This past week was a crazy one. Chris traveled to Dallas, TX to attend FINCON. I stayed home with our three girls while still recovering from my sciatic nerve pain.

I knew that my energy and mobility would be limited with the pain, so we made a game plan to survive the five days without Chris. Watch the video to find out how I survived!

This video is under five minutes long. Hope you enjoy our singing!
