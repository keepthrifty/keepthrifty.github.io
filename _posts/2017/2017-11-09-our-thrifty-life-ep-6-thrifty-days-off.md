There are usually five school days in a week, but all too often, there is an inservice day that cancels school and leaves you wondering, ___now what?___

In the past, these have been lazy pajama days. And that’s OK. But with Chris in the middle of [his Mini-Retirement]({% post_url 2017/2017-07-11-one-year-mini-retirement %}), we decided to make these days a little extra special. We didn’t want to spend a lot of money though.

Watch to see _what Chris’ hair looks like when he takes off his hat_ and find out how we spent a school-free afternoon with our three girls.

_We hope you enjoy this chat and let us know how you get through those extra days off of school with your kiddos!_
