It started with automated bill-pay and has grown into robo-advisers and automated savings. The personal finance world is been abuzz with talk of __automation__. We dream of letting the machines handle rote tasks to give us the opportunity to free up our time for creative pursuits. As a software developer, you'd think I'd be a huge advocate of automation, but I don't think you should hand over the reins to the software so easily.

There's a big difference between letting automation _help_ you with your finances and leaning on automation to _handle_ your finances.

## When Automation's Good

Automation is _great_ when it comes to handling things that are repetitive and easily defined.

_Transfer $10 to my fun money account every week on Friday_ is a great example.

## When Automation's Not

How I distinguish; then examples

## Automated Bill Pay

Where I'd automat

## Automated Investing

tax loss harvesting, rebalancing make sense
but i wouldn't

## Automated Tracking: The Fitbit for Personal Finance (not so much)



While automation can provide a ton of value, there's a danger to giving over control of your finances to the machines.



- Example of mindless bill pay
- What does automated tracking buy you?
- What does manual tracking get you on top of that? What's the cost? Is it worth it?
