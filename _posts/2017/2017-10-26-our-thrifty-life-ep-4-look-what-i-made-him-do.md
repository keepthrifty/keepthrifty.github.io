Chris and I had so much fun making this video. Chris shaved (his beard) a few days ago and I let my crazy hair down.

I’ve been stuck in bed for over a week with sciatic nerve pain. Chris has been amazing, taking care of everything for me and our girls while I try to rest and heal. He even did something he’s never done before - watch this video to find out what he did!

This video is under four minutes long. Hope you enjoy!

_Wives - have you ever sent your husband to do the shopping? Husbands - ever been stuck in a store trying to figure out what leggings are?_
