_"I mean, if you can make that work financially, that sounds amazing."_ We've heard this countless times since starting to talk about [my one-year mini-retirement]({% post_url 2017/2017-07-11-one-year-mini-retirement %}). The response implies that we must be in some special category of people - that mini-retirement is reserved only for a select few. But we're not that special and the formula for creating a mini-retirement is pretty simple.

Here it is:

```
(Vision + Budget + Means) x Dedication
```

_That's it?_

You got it. It's not rocket science.

We built a vision for our mini-retirement, figured out how much it would cost, and then created the means to make it a reality. Because of our excitement and dedication, we were able to get there faster.

Today, we'll look at each piece of the formula and the methods to make sure you've got them covered.

## Variable 1: Vision

The formula for creating a mini-retirement is easy - but the implementation can be really hard. If you don't have a clear vision of what you're working toward, do you think you'll be able to make the tough trade-offs to get there?

By building a clear vision of what you hope to accomplish in mini-retirement, you can provide motivation for yourself and your family and scope out what the budget will need to cover.

Maybe you're looking to make a whirlwind tour of Southeast Asia. Or you're excited to dedicate some serious time to your favorite non-profit. Maybe you just want to be able to [spend more time with your family and give entrepreneurship a shot]({% post_url 2017/2017-09-26-trade-financial-freedom-mini-retirement %}).

Whatever your hope is, you need to take the time to open your mind, collect your dreams, and get them down on paper.

Let's go through an activity to jump-start the process.

### Vision-Building Activity: "Money is No Object"

If you're single, you can do this activity alone. If you're married, involve your spouse and kids. You're going to need some paper or a computer - you should really write or type your answers.

Ask yourself: _"If money were no object, how would I/we spend my time in the next month?"_

Then ask the question again but for three months.

Then again for six months.

Then again for a year.

If you're having trouble coming up with ideas, consider resurrecting some [childhood dreams]({% post_url 2017/2017-09-19-bring-back-your-childhood-dreams %}).

Leave the world wide open and go through the W's:

- Who would you spend more time with?
- What would you do? What activities, events?
- When can these be done? Are some seasonal or scheduled on certain days? Or can they be done anytime?
- Where would you want to go or be?
- Most importantly, circle back on each of these and ask __why__

Let me hammer that last point home. Circle back on each idea you wrote down and ask __why__ that's important to you. __Why__ do you want to spend time with that person? __Why__ is that activity or event important to you? __Why__ must the timing be "just so"? __Why__ does that location fit this picture?

The goal in asking __why__ is to get to the heart of your dreams.

This will let you challenge and break barriers. Maybe the timeline or location aren't as important as you initially thought. Maybe you're only pursuing that because it's what would impress your friends or family -- but it's not actually what you want. Maybe you can find a way to get what you're looking for in a totally different way.

Once you've challenged your answers, 

Look for the common themes and threads across your different timelines.
