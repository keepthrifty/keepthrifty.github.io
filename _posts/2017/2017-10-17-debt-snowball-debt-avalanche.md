There are two oft-promoted methods of destroying your debt - _Debt Snowball_ and _Debt Avalanche_. The hardcore personal finance pros tend to scoff at "Debt Snowball" as a sub-optimal way to achieve debt freedom. But how much better is Debt Avalanche anyway? Is it enough to make a measurable difference?

In typical Keep Thrifty style, let's answer this question with a spreadsheet. After all today is __National Spreadsheet Day__.

## The Debt Snowball vs Debt Avalanche Spreadsheet

National Spreadsheet Day? Yes, there's such a thing and some nerds like me even put it in their calendar as it makes for great blog post inspiration :)

In honor of this historic day, I created a spreadsheet to look at the actual impact of using "Debt Avalanche" over "Debt Snowball" - to see how big of a difference the optimal method really makes.

If you know what Debt Snowball and Debt Avalanche are, you can jump straight to Google Sheets and start plugging numbers:

If you're not familiar with the Debt Snowball and Debt Avalanche concepts, read on to hear a bit about them and then circle back to the sheet once you're ready.

## Debt Snowball vs Debt Avalanche

It's easiest to describe these with an example.

Let's say our buddy Jim has racked up a bit of debt and is looking to get out:

|---------------+-------------------+------------+-----------------|
| Debt          | Current Principal | Rate (APR) | Minimum Payment |
|:-------------:+------------------:+-----------:+----------------:|
| Auto Loan     | $5,500            | 4.00%      | $200            |
| Credit Card   | $6,000            | 12.00%     | $125            |
| Personal Loan | $4,500            | 6.00%      | $150            |
|---------------+-------------------+------------+-----------------|

If Jim just makes these minimum payments for every month going forward, he's going to be paying this for a while.

Paying $470 a month for these, it's going to take Jim 5.5 years to get debt free and it's going to cost him over $2,800 in interest.

Jim's not happy and wants to accelerate his debt payoff, so he scrounges up another $200 a month in his budget but isn't sure how to best use it to pay off his loans.

This is where Debt Snowball and Debt Avalanche come in.

### Debt Snowball

To use the Debt Snowball method, Jim organizes his debts from the _smallest balance_ to the biggest and plans to pay them off in that order.

He'll make minimum payments on each but will focus any additional funds on the _smallest balance_ first. In order, he'll be paying off his personal loan, then his auto loan, and finally his credit card debt.

Focusing on his personal loan first, Jim is able to pay $350 a month (the $150 minimum and his extra $200). He keeps at it and after 14 months, his crosses his first loan off the list.

At that point, he takes the $350 a month he had been applying to his personal loan and puts it toward his next smallest loan - his auto loan. By bumping his monthly payment from $200 to $550, he's gaining lots of momentum. Despite the size of the loan, he's able to knock it out just 5 months later.

There's just the credit card debt left at this point, but now Jim's a pro at this. He takes the $550 a month he had been putting toward his car payment and applies it toward his card. He's now making monthly $675 payments instead of just $125 and he's crushing it. In just 8 more months, he kills the last of his debt and has a beer to celebrate.

Using Debt Snowball, Jim was able to pay off all of his debt in 2 years and 3 months and spent $1600 in interest payments.

He became debt free 3.25 years earlier than if he had made minimum payments and saved over $1200 in interest.

### Debt Avalanche

To use the Debt Avalanche method, Jim organizes his debts from the _highest interest_ loan to the smallest and plans to pay them off in that order.

He'll make minimum payments on each but will focus any additional funds on the _highest interest_ first. In order, he'll be paying off his credit card debt, then his personal loan, and finally his auto loan.

Focusing on his credit card debt first, Jim is able to pay $325 a month toward his balance (the $125 minimum and his extra $200). He keeps at it and after 21 months, he's cleared his first loan.

At that point, he takes the $325 a month he had been applying to his credit cards and puts it toward his next highest interest loan - his personal loan. By bumping his monthly payment from $150 to $475, he's gaining momentum. Despite the size of the loan, he's able to knock it out just 4 months later.

There's just the credit card debt left at this point, but now Jim's a pro at this. He takes the $475 a month he had been putting toward his car payment and applies it toward his card. He's now making payments of $675 a month instead of just $200 and he quickly finishes his last debt off in just one additional month.

Using Debt Avalanche, Jim was able to pay off his whole debt in 2 years and 2 months and spent $1300 in interest payments.

He became debt free 3.33 years earlier than if he had made minimum payments and saved $1600 in interest.

## Where Psychology and Math Meet

Sometimes we're all a bit to perfectionistic: we fail to find satisfaction with a "really good" solution because it wasn't the "perfect solution".

It's clear that Debt Avalanche is better from a math perspective, but personal finance isn't usually that simple. See, we're not actually robots (even though some of us dance like them). We're flawed beings that make mistakes and deviate from our best laid plans even though we know that ruin lies ahead.

Let's be honest - Debt Avalanche is better _if you can stick with it_, but it took a full 21 months for Jim to get his first victory of paying off a loan in full. With Debt Snowball, Jim gets the personal pat-on-the back of a loan release letter after just 14 months.

## Sometimes Really Good Can Be Good Enough

The most powerful lever to paying off debt in both methods is that you __don't let up__. With both methods, paying off one debt completely just gives you _that much more_ to pay to the next one.

Whether the snowball grows or the avalanche cascades, you're still paying things down __way faster__ than with minimum payments.

Remember - using Debt Snowball, Jim paid off his debt in _less than half the time_ he would with minimum payments and he cut his interest by 45%. Compared to a minimum payment plan, Jim was a rock star and still deserves that beer.

## Bonus: What If Jim Can Only Pay The Minimums?

You might be thinking that this is all fine and dandy because Jim scrounged up that extra $200 a month. What if he could only play the minimums?

The good news is that both of these methods can still apply.

_Wait, what?_

Yep - remember what we decided earlier. The most powerful lever is choosing to __not let up__. Even with minimum payments, eventually Jim will pay off one of his debts (in this scenario, it happens to be his auto loan after 29 months). At that point, Jim can take the money he was applying to his auto payment and use it for either of his other loans.

Even just doing this saves Jim 2.25 years of being in debt and $540 in interest.
