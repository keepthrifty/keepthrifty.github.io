One of the best ways to flip your life is to identify audacious dreams and chase after them. Some people have great clarity of what's on their bucket list - the things they want to accomplish with their life. But others struggle, not even knowing where to start. If you're struggling with finding a big dream to chase after, you might find inspiration from a younger version of yourself.

## Digging Up Your Childhood Dreams

Children have an amazing ability to dream - to think of possibilities for the future without care for what others' perception might be.

As we get older, the space of possibilities for our lives tends to narrow as we are influenced by the messages we get from our peers, media, [and advertising]({% post_url 2017/2017-09-12-youre-the-product %}).

Some of this shift comes under the guise of "practicality", but in the end, it's sad how much of our childhood dreams we lose sight of.

As we've explored our goals in life, one of the recurring things I've seen is how our childhood dreams often stand the test of time.

Think back to your childhood. What did you want to be when you grew up? How did you picture your life? Where would you live? Where would you travel?

## A Little White Shack

When my wife, Jaime, was young, she dreamed of living in a little white shack with the love of her life and their kids. She didn't dream of having a ton of possessions or living in luxury - just being close with the people that mattered most to her and focusing on quality time together.

Jaime shared this dream with me a number of years ago and we realized how much the life spoke to each of us. Our grown-up sensibilities would tell us that our path should have been climbing the corporate ladder, upsizing to a bigger house and pursuing the material goods that show you've made it.

But her dream as a child was much more pure and honest to her character. Raw and unfiltered, this reflected her true priorities - priorities that I share.

Over the last few years, we've shed the possessions that didn't add value to our life and downsizing to a space that suited a more moderate lifestyle. With our recent purchase of a small piece of land, we now have plans to build our "little white shack" and make that dream come true.

What if your dream isn't all that "practical" though? It's easy enough to minimize and downsize, but what about a dream that may even be impossible?

## Reframing Dreams Using Why's

Maybe as a kid you wanted to be an astronaut. While there are a few of those around the world, it's not exactly the easiest job to get into. Setting that as your goal now may be the right move, but if it feels out of reach (or something would disqualify you altogether), you needn't give everything up - you just need to reframe it.

A great method to doing this is to use the "Why's" method. Many of us have been on the receiving end of this questioning - with our kids asking why to every answer we give.

You can turn that around though and use it to your own benefit. Let's play through the astronaut example.

I want to be an astronaut. _Why?_

I wish I could get into space. _Why?_

I love the thought of floating in zero-gravity. _Why?_

The thought of feeling weightless sounds so freeing. _Why?_

Because I'd be like a bird - able to soar without touching anything.

As we went through these questions, each answer led to something more practical and more actionable. By the end, we have a target that still accomplishes the goal without all the constraints of needing to be an actual astronaut.

There are all sorts of possibilities to satisfy the heart of why you wanted to be an astronaut without necessarily needing to get on a space shuttle.

To get the heart of being able to soar:

- Save up $5000 and go on a zero-gravity flight
- Get a pilot's license
- Try out hang gliding

Any of these are significantly more achievable than becoming an astronaut but get the spirit of the original dream. If you had wanted to be an astronaut as a kid, you now have three really cool options that you can put on your list and start pursuing.

## Why's In Action

As a kid, I wanted to do a ton of things when I got older. I wanted to be a stand-up comedian. I wanted to be a stay-at-home dad. I wanted to be a teacher. I wanted to run my own business and create software.

Any one of these might be possible, but doing all simultaneously would probably require a time machine.

By using _why's_ though, I've been able to get to the core of each of these in a way that makes them achievable regardless of my situation.

I said I wanted to be a stand-up comedian, but what I really wanted was to bring people joy - to make them laugh. I get a chance to try this with my wife and kids every day (much to their chagrin) with my cheesy sense of humor.

I said I wanted to be a stay-at-home dad, but what I really wanted was to be a present father - to give my children love and attention. I get a chance to do this with the time we carve out together - for movie nights, daddy/daughter dates, and everywhere between.

I said I wanted to be a teacher, but what I really wanted was a chance to share knowledge and help others. I get to do this through this blog - sharing what I've learned and learning from my readers as well.

I said I wanted to run my own business and create software, but this didn't need to be a full-time job. The work I've done the last few years with this blog and with Thrifty have given me a chance to dabble in this space and now, with my mini-retirement, I'm getting a chance to pursue them further.

## What Were Your Dreams?

As you look for inspiration and for the dreams in life you want to chase, think back to what you wanted as a kid. Dig into each possibility with the goal of finding the _heart_ of what that dream was really about. When you get there, you'll likely find a world of opportunity and excitement for the future.

_What were your dreams as a child? Have you accomplished those? For the ones you haven't, what does applying the "Why's" approach lead you to instead?_
