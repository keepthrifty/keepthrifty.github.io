What's this? A post on _Saturday_? That's right thrifty people, Keep Thrifty is expanding! Today marks the start of a new series that I'll be putting out every Saturday, containing links to my favorite finds from around the web.

The topics will usually be [money](/archive/#money), [minimalism](/archive/#minimalism), [mini-retirements](/archive/#mini-retirement), and [lifestyle design](/archive/#dreams-&-values), but anything is fair game.

Let's get this party started!

## Get More out of Your Job (Financially and Emotionally)

Our first post this week is from Melanie at [Mindfully Spent](https://www.mindfullyspent.com). We spend a crazy amount of time in our lives working. Being intentional about how you approach your career can lead you to make the most of those minutes and even improve your compensation. Melanie gives a deep dive into what she's learned and provides [Five strategies for building a meaningful career and increasing your income](https://www.mindfullyspent.com/home/five-strategies-to-successfully-increase-annual-income-get-raises-gain-responsibility-career-growth).

## Manage Money Better With Your Spouse

I read a terrible article this week from a mortgage company titled "Fighting with your Spouse? A 2nd Mortgage Might Fix Your Marriage and Your Money". I'm not even going to link to it because the whole concept is just so wrong.

Instead, here are two awesome articles this week about how to manage money better with your spouse:

- [7 Money Conversations to Have With Your Spouse](https://www.mamafishsaves.com/money-conversations-spouse/) from [Mama Fish Saves](https://www.mamafishsaves.com)
- [How To Be Awesome At Handling Money With Your Spouse](https://millennialmoneyman.com/how-to-be-awesome-at-handling-money-with-your-spouse/) from [Millennial Money Man](https://millennialmoneyman.com)

Both hit on the most important factor in a successful marriage: __communication__.

This applies regardless of whether we're talking about money or anything else.

## Have You Been Turned Off to Financial Independence?

Personal finance bloggers (myself included), often pitch the concept of Financial Independence (reaching the point where the gains from your investments can cover your expenses indefinitely) as the holy grail. But sometimes the way we talk about getting there can turn people off to the concept.

I'll put our story out here: _[we sold our house]({% post_url 2017/2017-04-10-living-in-half-of-our-house %}), moved into an apartment, [ditched most of our possessions]({% post_url 2016/2016-10-10-become-twice-as-happy-with-half-as-much %}), [buy as much as we can used]({% post_url 2017/2017-01-02-happy-nothing-new-year %}), and [sleep on the floor](http://www.jaimedeclutters.com/blog/2017/04/05/why-we-sleep-on-the-floor/)_.

You may find that some of these sound intriguing and others sound downright abhorrent - and that's _great_!

You need to figure out what works for you. There may be things you're willing to do (work crazy hours, take on high-risk investments, etc) that are way outside our comfort zone too.

In the end, financial independence and freedom are wonderful concepts to pursue regardless of your pathway there. We can all agree that having freedom and options are generally good. How you get there is up to you.

This topic was covered in-depth at [Our Next Life](https://ournextlife.com) in what was probably the most entertaining article title I saw this week: [Financial Independence, Fight Club and the Mindless Consumer Zombie Narrative](https://ournextlife.com/2017/09/20/fight-club-narrative/)

## That's a Wrap

I chose not to record audio for this one, but let me know if you'd like to see these in audio format in the future (like my main articles).

There you have it, folks. Hopefully, these get your gears turning this weekend. Have a great one!

_What do you think of the new format? Do you have any great articles you found this week?_
