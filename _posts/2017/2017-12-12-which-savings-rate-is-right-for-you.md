Too ambiguous, too misunderstood.

Why are you calculating your rate?

Amount Saved / Amount Possible

If you're trying to generally improve your financial situation, this could look something like this:

(Anything that improves net worth) / Take-home pay

If you're trying to save for financial independence, this could be:

(Contributions to passive income sources) / Gross pay

Methods:

SR = Savings / (Gross Income - Taxes + Employer Match)

https://esimoney.com/savings-rate-insights-financials/
SR = (Income - Taxes - Expenses) / Income

https://www.physicianonfire.com/calculators/savings-calculator/
SR (Gross) = (Match + Pre-tax Contrib + Post-tax) / (Salary + Match)
SR (Net) = (Match + Pre-tax Contrib + Post-tax) / (Take-Home + Employer Match + Pre-tax Contributions)
Contrib = mortgage princ, student loan prin, 529, taxable or roth Contributions
