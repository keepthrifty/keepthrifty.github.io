It's the weekend and that means it's time for another Saturday Stash! Read on for some of the best articles around the web from the week to help you define your version of freedom and work toward it.

_The Saturday Stash is round-up of my favorite finds from the week that I think you might enjoy. The topics will usually be [money](/archive/#money), [minimalism](/archive/#minimalism), [mini-retirements](/archive/#mini-retirement), and [lifestyle design](/archive/#dreams-&-values), but anything is fair game._

_Check them out, show their authors some love, and keep thrifty!_

## How to Be Frugal With Your Time, Not Just Your Money

My [definition of thrifty]({% post_url 2017/2017-06-13-our-not-so-thrifty-past %}#defining-thrifty) is _"using money and other resources carefully toward oneâ€™s most important dreams and values"_. In particular, those _other resources_ are your time and your attention.

The [Frugalwoods](http://www.frugalwoods.com) are well known for being frugal (or in my definition, thrifty) with their money but this week they covered another of those precious resources.

Read the Frugalwoods advice on [how to be frugal with your time, not just your money](http://www.frugalwoods.com/2017/09/29/how-to-be-frugal-with-your-time-not-just-your-money).

## Are You Developing Your Financial Muscles?

I love a good analogy, so I'm excited to share this one from Ty at [Get Rich Quickish](http://www.getrichquickish.com) - a guest post from [Actuary on Fire](https://www.actuaryonfire.com).

In it, the actuary explains why pull-ups are the physical equivalent of the pursuit of financial independence. Not sure how? Check out his take on why you should [pull yourself up financially and physically](https://www.getrichquickish.net/2017/10/pull-yourself-up.html).

## Live Your Retirement Today

> <cite>Benjamin Franklin</cite>

If Ben Franklin, the original personal finance blogger, says it, you should probably listen.

Mrs. [Adventure Rich](https://www.adventurerich.com) wrote a great article this week applying Ben's thinking to a topic near and dear to all of us - our retirement.

We're trying to live our retirement today by taking a mini-retirement, but Mrs. Adventure Rich outlines great ways in which she's living her retirement while still working. Check out her article on how to [live your retirement today](https://www.adventurerich.com/live-retirement-today/).

## What Would You Do If You Lost Your Wedding Ring Diamond?

We have our own story about my wife's ring (_you know, the one where [she sold it]({% post_url 2016/2016-03-23-engagement-ring-sold %})_), and I really recommend you check this one from [Love Liberty Shelter](http://www.lovelibertyshelter.com) out.

It's a story of losing the stone from her wedding ring - a family heirloom. You never know how you're going to react until something like this happens to you and her reaction may surprise you. Check out her account of [the lost diamond](http://www.lovelibertyshelter.com/the-missing-diamond/).

## How Much Time Is Your Stuff Worth?

Over the course of 20 years, you spend 40,000 of work to pay your bills and ultimately, to acquire stuff (both physical things and experiences). When you look back, are your things and experiences worth those 40,000 hours?

Carl Richards, writer at the New York Times, dives deeper with the question: [Is the stuff you buy over 20 years worth 40,000 hours of time?](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/08/21/your-money/is-the-stuff-you-buy-over-20-years-worth-40000-hours-of-time.html).
