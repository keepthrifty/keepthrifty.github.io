## Post Showdown: Should You Prepay Your Mortgage?

This is one of those battles that will rage on until the end of time. Does prepaying your mortgage make sense?

- Andy from [Marriage, Kids, and Money](http://www.marriagekidsandmoney.com) gives [8 Compelling Reasons to Pay Off Your Mortgage Early](http://www.marriagekidsandmoney.com/8-compelling-reasons-to-pay-off-your-mortgage-early/)
- [Mr. 1500](http://www.1500days.com) had a great guest post on [Budgets Are Sexy](http://www.budgetsaresexy.com) about why he doesn't fret about debt. In particular, Mr. 1500 could have purchased his last house in cash but [chose a mortgage instead and invested what he would have paid](http://www.budgetsaresexy.com/why-i-dont-worry-about-debt/)

We can all agree that both prepaying your mortgage and investing are better than blowing your money on scratch-off tickets. In this case, we're really talking about which is the better of two _good_ options.

I outlined my thoughts on [when to prepay your mortgage instead of investing](https://www.keepthrifty.com/2016/06/05/prepay-vs-invest.html) and to me, it all comes down to _your risk tolerance_. Investing _can_ and _has_ been the better option many times.

__But not every time.__

There's always a chance that investing will leave you worse off than prepaying. If that difference is "too rich for your blood", then prepaying is still a great thing to do.

Where do you stand?

## Get Your Employer to OK a Mini-Retirement

I'm not the only one out here broadcasting the awesomeness of mini-retirements - Jillian (AKA [Ms. Montana](http://www.montanamoneyadventures.com)) has been an awesome advocate as well.

This week, Jillian had a great guest post on [Millennial Money](https://millennialmoney.com) with advice on [how to negotiate a mini-retirement](https://millennialmoney.com/negotiate-a-mini-retirement/) with your employer. I'm 100% on-board with her recommendations. Check it out!

## Do You Want to Make Money Online?

No, I'm not about to point you to some get-rich-quick scheme. You know that's not how I roll. Heck, I'm [running this site without ads](https://www.patreon.com/keepthrifty)!

[Brent Truitt](https://www.debtfiles.com) had a great guest post on [Mystery Money Man](http://www.mysterymoneyman.com) this week where he talked about the reality of making money online. In Brent's words:

> Here is the list of reasons why I shouldn't have succeeded, according to the naysayers:
> - I was too old...
> - I had no experience...
> - I'm lazy...
> - I'm not very smart...
> - I'm not patient...
> - It was too late...

If Brent can [make a living online](http://www.mysterymoneyman.com/out-of-my-mind-full-time-internet-marketer-shares-his-story/) with all of these going against him, maybe you (or I) can too.

## One Simple Way to Kickstart Your Money-Saving Habits

In the path to financial discipline, the next step after starting to [track your spending](https://thrifty.keepthrifty.com) is to look for areas of your budget you can reduce so you can make room for savings or other priorities.

But that can be intimidating - how can you possibly make a dent in a huge budget?

Des from [Half Banked](https://www.halfbanked.com) knocked it out of the park with this simple (but powerful method) to [kickstart your money-saving habits](https://www.halfbanked.com/one-simple-way-kickstart-money-saving-habits/).

As the saying goes, the best way to eat an elephant is one bite at a time.

## Announcement: Our Thrifty Life

Jaime and I had a really fun week this week. In particular, we finally got through stage one of a project we've been working on - creating a YouTube video series called _Our Thrifty Life_

__That's right - we're going to start vlogging!__

We'll be launching in a couple weeks and will be putting out __a new video every Thursday__. Episodes will be short - less than 5 minutes each - and we'll talk about our story and what leading a thrifty life means to us.

Are you excited? We certainly are! Subscribe to my e-mail list below and you'll be the first to hear when we launch!

_We've got tons of topics picked for Our Thrifty Life, but we'd love to hear from you. If you could ask us anything, what would you want to know?_
