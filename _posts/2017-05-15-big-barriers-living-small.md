This was a big week for our family. We accepted an offer on our 1900 square-foot house and signed a lease to move into a 1166 square-foot apartment! We've been planning on downsizing for some time and are exited to finally be there. One of the biggest surprises we had in this process was how __hard__ it is to find smaller places to live in our area, _especially as a family of five_.

[In 1950, the average new build home size was 983 square feet](http://www.yesmagazine.org/planet/the-righteous-small-house-challenging-house-size-and-the-irresponsible-american-dream){: target="_blank"}. In our town today, we can't find a single place that size that we could live in - whether renting or buying.

## Why We Want To Live Small

As we went through remodeling and updating our house over the last years, we came to recognize that we were perfectly happy living in a smaller space. As a result, we've spent much of the last two years [living in half of our house]({% post_url 2017-04-10-living-in-half-of-our-house %}).

By living smaller, we can improve our financial situation, reduce our environmental impact, and save time by having less to clean and maintain. We've found that minimalism (and, in particular, living smaller) takes a huge weight of burden off of our shoulders and allows us to better focus our time and money on the things that we deeply value: our faith, our family, and our personal growth.

## Scoping Our Housing Search

As such, we've been discussing downsizing for some time and had pursued a variety of options. As we were looking, we were primarily looking at options in our current suburb, as we've got a strong connection to our church, have some amazing friends we've made in the area, and have great schools for our kids to attend.

We've looked at three different routes to live smaller - building a _small house_, living in a _tiny house_ (on wheels), or renting a _small apartment_. In each of these, we encountered significant barriers to actually following through. Here's what we learned and how we were finally able to find a way to let us live smaller.

## It's Hard to Build and Place a Tiny House

<div class="image-caption">Nomad's Nest from <a href="http://www.windrivertinyhomes.com/" target="_blank">Wind River Tiny Homes</a></div>

The growing interest of tiny houses should be evident from the popularity of shows like [Tiny House Nation](http://amzn.to/2rehtHR){: rel="nofollow" target="_blank"} and [Tiny House Hunters](http://amzn.to/2qEQYyf){: rel="nofollow" target="_blank"}. That said, building codes and zoning restrictions haven't caught up in most places to make building a tiny house on wheels a viable proposition.

Zoning ordinances in our area define a minimum dwelling size of 24 feet by 40 feet, which means a tiny house definitely can't be a dwelling here. Tiny houses typically have a maximum width of _8 feet 6 inches_. In addition, dwellings are required to have a permanent, continuous foundation compliant with the Wisconsin uniform dwelling code.

A good portion of tiny-house dwellers have their homes classified as RVs and park in an RV park. Alas, we have no RV park in our little suburb and so, we are out of luck.

Our best bet here would then be to find someone who'd be willing to let us park a tiny house in their yard and cross our fingers that the neighbors don't complain.

Given my general distaste for the thought of being homeless with my wife and three kids, we have to rule out the concept of a tiny house on wheels.

_There has been some recent good news on the tiny house building code front - In December of 2016, the [International Code Council approved Appendix V to the International Building Code](https://tinyhousebuild.com/tiny-house-appendix-passes/){: rel="nofollow" target="_blank"}, which describes building requirements for tiny houses! Before you go out and start [designing your own Tumbleweed tiny home](https://track.flexlinkspro.com/a.ashx?foid=1094139.1848122&foc=1&fot=9999&fos=1){: rel="nofollow" target="_blank"}, keep in mind that it'll take time before states adopt the annex and that local zoning laws may still be an issue._

## It's Hard to Build a Small House

![]({{site.url}}/img/posts/2017-05-15-big-barriers-living-small/small-houses.jpg)

So, I've already determined that our local zoning sets a minimum of 960 square feet for dwellings in our suburb. We think we could get by with much less, but let's say we wanted to get something around that size. If we open ourselves to a permanent, foundation-build house, how low can we _actually_ get in square footage?

If you thought 960, you're absolutely wrong. Here's why:

Beyond the zoning and building codes, there's another barrier that prevents building small - deed restrictions. These are contractual agreements placed on the deed of a plot of land that stipulate the requirements for usage of the land.

In short, these can set minimum square footage, building height, architectural standards, roof pitch, and all sorts of other details about what can be built.

I went through the deed restrictions for the major subdivisions (_it sounded like a fun thing to do on a Saturday night after everyone else was asleep_) and here's the progression I saw over time:

![Chart showing increasing minimum square footage restrictions over time for both one-story (from 1300 sq. ft. in 1993 to 1700 sq. ft. in 2013) and two-story homes (from 1600 sq. ft. in 1993 to 2000 sq. ft. in 2013).]({{site.url}}/img/posts/2017-05-15-big-barriers-living-small/minimum-square-footage-restrictions.jpg)

Over the the 20 years spanning 1993 to 2013, the minimum square footage required by deed restrictions for both one-story homes and two-story homes increased by 400 square feet each. For one-story homes, the minimum square footage grew by 31%; for two-story homes it grew by 25%.

It's no wonder the [average home size has increased by 1000 square feet since 1973](http://www.aei.org/publication/todays-new-homes-are-1000-square-feet-larger-than-in-1973-and-the-living-space-per-person-has-doubled-over-last-40-years/){: target="_blank"} - developers are building the increase __right into the deed restrictions__!

I guess this makes sense though. In real terms (adjusted for inflation), the cost per square foot of building houses has been relatively stagnant over that same time period. If you're a developer and you want to increase your revenue, your only other options are to build more homes or bigger homes.

So, even though our city would allow us to build a 960 square-foot home, there's only one subdivision that would let us build anywhere close (1100 square feet) and that subdivision is so old all the lots are taken. If we want to build in any of the current lots, we'd be forced to build a house that's at least 1700 square feet on the first floor.

When you take basement space into account, the smallest house we'd be allowed to build in our suburb would be __even bigger__ than the house we're currently in.

## It's Hard to Rent a Small Apartment

![]({{site.url}}/img/posts/2017-05-15-big-barriers-living-small/small-apartment.jpg)

With tiny houses on wheels and small foundation-build houses out of the realm of possibility, maybe we'll have better luck renting.

When I was looking through the deed restrictions, I noticed that a lot of the documentation had different requirements for multi-unit buildings. For duplexes, the minimum square footage was often 1100 square feet per unit and for triplexes and quadplexes, the minimum was typically 800 square feet per unit.

We were optimistic this would be our solution so, as we got our house listed, we started searching for apartments in the area.

We were pleasantly surprised to find a number of two-bedroom apartments in the 1100-1200 square-foot range. Our girls all share a room and we've had good success with that for the last few years, so we started making phone calls to landlords.

But we got rejected by one after another. _Why, you ask?_

Two words: __maximum occupancy__.

By federal law, landlords are not allowed to discriminate against renters based on being a part of a protected class - including for "family status". In theory, this means that a landlord can't refuse to rent to you because you're pregnant or have kids.

That said, the Wisconsin fair housing guidance documentation lists an important exception:

> A family with “too many” people may be turned away, if a reasonable government requirement limits the number of occupants for the dwelling unit.

In general, guidelines from the Department of Housing and Urban Development state 2 people per bedroom as the standard. As a family of five, this puts us in a tough spot when we are looking for a two-bedroom apartment.

From a legal perspective, HUD also considers the size of bedrooms, configuration of the unit,
and other physical limitations of housing for fair housing complaints, but there's no black-and-white rule that will let you know ahead of time whether a landlord will accept your application (or whether they have to).

We were _turned down for four different two-bedroom units_ before we finally found a landlord that thought we were a good fit. It may have helped that they got a chance to see my credit score before deciding on us - knowing we've got a really solid track record of paying our bills certainly couldn't have hurt!

## Why This Sucks for Society

We were able to find a place that met our downsizing goals while still being in our current city, but it certainly wasn't easy. I'd even go as far as to say that there was a bit of luck involved.

What would we have done if we hadn't been able to find something? Move to a different town? Stick it out in our current, oversized house?

I can't say for certain. The fact that it was __so difficult__ to accomplish this seems a sad state of affairs:

- Our local, state, and national governments are unnecessarily restricting us from building safe, effective housing in the form of tiny houses
- Our developers and builders are inflating home sizes by establishing higher minimum square footages using deed restrictions
- Our landlords are forcing families to rent bigger, more expensive apartments - even if they don't want or need the space

We're putting people in a position where they are incentivized to violate building codes, deed restrictions, or lie about the number of kids they have.

## Finding Other Ways to Live Small

In about a year, we'll be considering whether to renew the lease in our 2-bedroom apartment. If the things above haven't changed, we'll be back in the same boat in considering our options.

If we choose to leave the apartment but want to stay in our city, we'll need to consider other options:

- Build a multi-unit building and live in one of the units ourselves
- Get lucky enough to find and purchase a small existing home in the one subdivision that meets our square footage goals

Otherwise, we'll need to consider what's more important - our desire to live small or our desire to continue to live in the city we've called home for the last 10 years.

_Do you think that the current systems are taking away peoples' freedom to choose where they want to live? Many of these were added to protect individuals and businesses but maybe there's a better way. What are your suggestions?_
