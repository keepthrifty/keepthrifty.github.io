OK Thrifters, we made it to the end of the month, let's check how we did on bringing down our grocery spending for [this month's challenge][april-challenge-post].

![April mid-month results - $1132.51 total][april-2016-final]

I started this month with an ambitious goal of $880 and we shot over by $250.

In the mid-month update, I recognized that this was a five-Friday month and that our target realistically should have been more like $1015, but we even went over that by $115.

Overall, we had a crazy month; our twins turned five, we had a lot more hosting of friends and family and we found ourselves short-stocked on some of our staples that we tend to buy in bigger quantities.

So where does this put us?

![Chart showing grocery spending since August 2016][april-2016-grocery-chart]

<div class="image-caption" markdown="span">Man, [Thrifty][thrifty-link] is nice for these kinds of questions...ok, that was a shameless plug, but [Thrifty][thrifty-link] is free!</div>

Since August, our monthly grocery spending has ranged from $836.25 to $1410.69. None of this is terrible for a family of five where we live, but certainly I'd like to keep to the lower end of that spectrum if possible :)

We're averaging $1048 a month at this point and while I'd like to do better, I'm thinking we should try to take this one step at a time.

With that in mind, I'm going to _repeat_ the grocery [challenge for May][may-challenge] but this time with a new target that also includes eating out.

## How did you do? #

Hopefully you did a bit better than me this month. Whether you did or not, I'm looking forward to trying to tackle food as a whole in May!
