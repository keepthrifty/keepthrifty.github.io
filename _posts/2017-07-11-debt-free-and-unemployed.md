Last year, we set an audacious goal to become completely debt-free by 2020 by aggressively paying down our mortgage. Last week, we accomplished our goal early by moving into an apartment, selling our house, and paying off our last cent of debt. While this has been a huge change, it's only a piece of an even bigger life change - I parted ways with my employer at the end of June; __I'm now unemployed__.

The best news? _I'm not freaking out._

Years ago, I would have probably had six or seven panic attacks at the thought of losing my steady paycheck, but through our journey, I've grown so much that I'm embracing this life change.

Thanks to the financial discipline we've developed, this isn't a crisis - it's an incredible opportunity.

## Changing Mentality

Over the last 18 months, we had been targeting debt freedom as a first step toward a bigger goal - financial independence. We were excited at the thought of _not owing anyone anything_ and eventually getting to the point that I wouldn't need to work to support our lifestyle.

We acted with decisiveness and enthusiasm. We [sold my wife's engagement ring]({% post_url 2016-03-23-engagement-ring-sold %}), aggressively [paid down our mortgage]({% post_url 2016-04-10-how-we-saved-on-our-mortgage %}), [downsized to one car]({% post_url 2017-01-16-one-car-suburbs %}), sold and donated our [unnecessary possessions]({% post_url 2016-10-10-become-twice-as-happy-with-half-as-much %}), and created [fun financial metrics]({% post_url 2017-01-30-introducing-retirement-freedom %}) to help us stay motivated on the path to financial independence.

But the more we focused on the goal, the more I began to realize that debt freedom and financial independence alone weren't going to bring us fulfillment. I had to come to terms with the fact that those aren't the real goals - they are means to an end, but not the end by themselves.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In the pursuit of meaningful, rich lives, too many of us mistake the tools and resources as the goals. Money is a resource, not an answer.</p>&mdash; Chris Durheim (@keepthrifty) <a href="https://twitter.com/keepthrifty/status/865961796703858689">May 20, 2017</a></blockquote>

With this recognition, we've had to redefine what we're really striving for. If it's not based on a financial metric, is it just the simple answer - happiness?

Happiness is subject to the whims of fate. One unexpected tragedy can shatter happiness.

It may seem like I'm mincing words, but the distinction is important. Fulfillment expresses a lasting satisfaction with life - _knowing that we have lived according to our values and chased our dreams_.

When we picked our debt freedom goal 18 months ago, we didn't have an end-game. On the other side, we had dreams but no solid plan of how to achieve them.

Then, a few months ago, everything started coming together.

## My Alter Ego

From 2004 through 2017, I worked at a medical device company as a part of the engineering team, creating life support equipment. My role for the last eight years had been engineering manager.

The work was challenging and interesting; my co-workers were passionate, incredibly bright, and a whole lot of fun. Most of all, the impact of what we worked was intensely tangible. We worked on devices that literally supported the lives of friends, co-workers, and family members - even one of my daughters.

No job is perfect though. As a part of a publicly-trade company in a highly-regulated industry, we had a lot of paperwork, a lot of meetings, and a lot of focus on short-term results. Like any job, we had good times and not-so-good times and this spring, we had entered a not-so-good time.

In our home life, we had been aggressively pursuing our new path to debt freedom - downsizing from our 1900 square-foot house to a 1200 square-foot apartment, eliminating our mortgage, the last of our debt.

As my wife and I crunched the numbers and looked at the cash we'd have as the net proceeds from the sale of our house, we came to an interesting fact.

With our projected annual spending, we would have three full years of expenses sitting in cash.

Even if we didn't want to spend all of it, we could easily buy a full year of freedom with that money. A year to chase our dreams and retool our life based on what we value most.

## A Sabbatical by Any Other Name

{% capture tweet-text %}All of the financial discipline we had applied over the years yielded something amazing - options{% endcapture %}{% include tweet-link.html %}


- A few months ago, everything clicked into place - brief version of GE departure
- God's plan coming into place - downsizing in accordance with right timing to leave job

- The financial discipline we had over the last few years (ring, mortgage interest minimization, )

- How I'll feel about leaving my company (people, products)

- What we're going to do next
- 1-year sabbatical
- We spent the last several years working hard to better align our spending with our values
- Now we're making the bigger, tougher leap - to align our time with our values

- Our values - what we'll be spending time (and money) on
  - Faith
    - praying daily (habit app)
  - Family
    - everyone says kids grow up too fast; trying to act on that
  - Fun
    - always wanted to be my own boss - work on my own thing.
    - How this ties to KT/Thrifty
      - KT - new focus (Thrifty definition)
      - Thrifty - new focus - new features, better support/info, and exiting beta

- The death bed test

- Fulfillment comes from applying your limited resources (time and money) to achieve your dreams while staying true to your values.
