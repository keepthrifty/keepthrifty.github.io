Last year, we set a goal to become completely debt-free by 2020. While we had been proactively paying down debt in the years prior to this, finishing off our mortgage by 2020 was audacious. Last week, we accomplished our goal in a different way, by moving into an apartment, selling our house, and paying off our last cent of debt. While this has been a huge change, it's only a piece of an even bigger life change. Along with all of this, I'm now unemployed.

- Debt freedom was a means to an end, but we didn't really have the end picked out.
- We knew our dreams but didn't have a detailed plan on how to get there
- A few months ago, everything clicked into place - brief version of GE departure
- God's plan coming into place - downsizing in accordance with right timing to leave job

- The financial discipline we had over the last few years (ring, mortgage interest minimization, )

- How I'll feel about leaving my company (people, products)

- What we're going to do next
- 1-year sabbatical
- We spent the last several years working hard to better align our spending with our values
- Now we're making the bigger, tougher leap - to align our time with our values

- Our values - what we'll be spending time (and money) on
  - Faith
    - praying daily (habit app)
  - Family
    - everyone says kids grow up too fast; trying to act on that
  - Fun
    - always wanted to be my own boss - work on my own thing.
    - How this ties to KT/Thrifty
      - KT - new focus (Thrifty definition)
      - Thrifty - new focus - new features, better support/info, and exiting beta

- The death bed test

- Fulfillment comes from applying your limited resources (time and money) to achieve your dreams while staying true to your values.
