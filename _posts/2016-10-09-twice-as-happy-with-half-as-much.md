How would you react if you were told you that you had to give up half of all of your stuff? Drop from two cars down to one. Move out of your home and into a place that's half the size. Does it sound terrifying, or does it sound a little bit exciting?



___TK___
- Mental tax/burden of carrying stuff
- Not only

- Five ways we're doing this
  - Half the kitchen (no microwave, no dishwasher; just stove and fridge; even got rid of toaster and made toast in the oven. takes longer for first piece but overall was just as fast)
    - Seriously, toast from the oven is actually better
  - Half the dinnerware (plates, forks, etc) - no building up of stuff; forced to wash it when done using it so it's ready for next time
  - Half the cars (we've been a 1-car family for 9 months)
    - Extra time with Jaime when she drives me - no impact otherwise
  - Half the wardrobe (list out what I have) - no time deciding on what to wear; I really like every shirt i own; same with laundry as dishes - no building up and having a "laundry day" - we just do a load a day on average; if you forget in wash still time to get it dried
  - Half the house (list sq footage, rooms) - less cleaning; less stuff/furniture. if actually downsized: less heating & cooling
