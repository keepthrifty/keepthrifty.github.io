My life has felt like a constant shift from one commitment to the next. As soon as one meeting finished, another was about to begin. In the open spaces of my calendar, I did my best to keep up with my inbox, respond to texts, and reply on Twitter. I was a fool, putting myself in a position where my obligations were in charge of my attention. One of my goals in [my mini-retirement]({% post_url 2017-07-11-one-year-mini-retirement %}) is to take back my schedule (and my sanity) by shifting my actions from "push" to "pull".

## Push vs Pull

Push-based actions are responsive - answering an e-mail or phone call, replying to a text, liking a post you've been notified of, or accepting a meeting you were invited to.

While push actions are effective at accomplishing someone else's agenda, it's not always effective at accomplishing your own.

If the phone hadn't rung, you wouldn't have called that telemarketer just to chat. If the e-mail never came, you wouldn't have spent time trying to figure out whether or not to wire money to that Nigerian prince. If your cell didn't buzz, you wouldn't have even thought about reading an article to discover which state has the worst tippers.

Push actions are reactive and, if framed properly, bypass that part of your brain that asks whether the action is likely worth your attention. Push actions drive information you didn't ask for and imply the need for an action you probably weren't planning on.

What's your default mode when you get a meeting invite at work? Most people I know accept every invite that comes their way. But is it the best use of their time? Not usually. _How many hours of pointless meetings have you suffered through?_

Push actions bypass intention.

Pull-based actions are the opposite. These are actions that you do because you think they will provide value - brainstorming a blog post and doing the research to back it up, reaching out to a friend you want to maintain contact with, or coming up with a fun day for your family at the park.

Pull actions are loaded with intention because you were the initiator.

## Case Example: Phone Notifications

I'm a part of the [Oregon Trail]({% post_url 2016-11-20-money-life-lessons-oregon-trail %}) generation - the older millennials that remember what life was like before widely-accessible internet and cell phones. I held off on getting a cell phone until I was in my senior year of college for precisely the push-vs-pull argument - I didn't want people to assume I was always available.

I finally caved and the techie side of me really likes the capability that new apps bring to my phone and my life. Over the years, though, app developers have become incredibly good at taking advantage of push notifications on our phones to demand our attention.

I've got 80 apps on my phone competing for my attention - and they don't just want it when I'm staring at my phone. They want my attention in the middle my kids' dance recitals, in the middle of date night, in the middle of that awesome dream I was having.

Our phones are attention hogs and they're very good at getting what they want. Americans check their phones, on average, [46 times a day](http://time.com/4147614/smartphone-usage-us-2015/). That's once every 21 minutes if we're only checking when we're awake.

It's gotten so bad that we've created a term - _Phantom Vibration Syndrome_ to describe that feeling of your phone vibrating that turns out to be nothing. According to one doctor, a more appropriate way to term this is a [_tactile hallucination_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_vibration_syndrome).

That's right, our phones are demanding our attention to the point that we are having hallucinations.

So, after reading a great article on Wired about the benefits of [turning off push notifications](https://www.wired.com/story/turn-off-your-push-notifications/), I've spent the last month experimenting with one more form of minimalism - minimal pushes.

I went into my phone's settings and disabled notifications (visual, audio, and tactile) for __every app__ with a few exceptions.

- Clock - I use my phone as a timer for cooking so I need notifications to go off when timers expire
- Calendar - Meetings are rare for me these days but I need the reminder
- Find My Device - If my phone is lost, this will help me find and locate it
- Habit - an app I'm using to remind me to do a few things that are really important in my life - praying daily and setting up date nights with my wife
- Text messaging

Text Messaging is the only one that is "push", but 99% of those pushes are from my wife - it's an important one to keep on :)

Noticeably absent from this list: Gmail, Twitter, Google Plus, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Capital One, Feedly, Google Photos, Skype, and YouTube

So what does this look like in real life?

It means I check my e-mail when I've got the time and attention to do so.

It means I check Twitter and my other social media accounts when I want to see what's going on and when I've got time to respond.

It means I check my bank accounts and blog feeds when I have a good reason.

### How The Switch to Pull Has Improved My Life

I don't check my phone nearly as often these days. I'm less prone to pick it up just to see if a notification is there - because I know they won't be.

Sure, it's meant that my response to your email or reply to your tweet might come a little bit later. But if we're really honest, most emails, tweets, and even texts aren't actually all that urgent.

We've become trained to expect instant gratification, but the reality is that real gratification doesn't come from instant results - it comes from being mindful of where your attention is focused.

When we sit at the dinner table, I'm much less likely to pick up my phone. When I'm waiting for one of my daughters to finish brushing her teeth, I'm much more likely to talk with the others rather than find a quick distraction.

It's been awesome and I can't imagine going back.

## Give It a Shot - Start With Your Phone

If you want to make the switch from push to pull, I recommend starting with your phone. It's likely one of the biggest attention hogs you've got.

So give it a shot. Whether you're on an [iPhone](https://www.imore.com/how-customize-notification-center-iphone-and-ipad) or [Android](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/stop-annoying-notifications-android/), it's worth trying out for a few weeks to see what the impact is.

Once you've got control of your attention, you can make sure you're using it for the things that are more important.

_Have you made the switch from push to pull with your phone or any other area of your life? How would you recommend others move into more of a pull-mindset?_
