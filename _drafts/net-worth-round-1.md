One year ago, I launched [Thrifty][thrifty-link], my web-based expense and income tracking tool and became the first user. Our family has logged every penny we've earned, paid in taxes, and spent on expenses over the last 12 months. Here's what we've learned and where we plan to go from here.

#

What I count in net worth:
- Value of house (minus outstanding mortgage balance)
- Other outstanding debt (car, credit card, etc)
- Value in retirement accounts (401k, IRA)
- Value in non-retirement investments

Net worth Aug 1, 2015: $265,547
Net worth Aug 1, 2016: $324,963
Change in Net Worth: $59416
  - Mortgage Debt               down  $17259
  - Car Loan                    down  $6815 (gone!)
  - House Value                 up    $5154
  - Retirement account balance  up    $30188

What I count as spending:
  - Anything that I can't directly measure as building net worth
  - This means home updates count as spending even though they likely increase home value
