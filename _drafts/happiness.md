But the more we focused on the goal, the more I began to realize that debt freedom and financial independence alone weren't going to bring us fulfillment. I had to come to terms with the fact that those aren't the real goals - they are means to an end, but not the end by themselves.

Money is a resource, not an answer.</p>&mdash; Chris Durheim (@keepthrifty) <a href="https://twitter.com/keepthrifty/status/865961796703858689">May 20, 2017</a></blockquote>

With this recognition, we've had to redefine what we're really striving for. If it's not based on a financial metric, is it just the simple answer - happiness?

Happiness is subject to the whims of fate. One unexpected tragedy can shatter happiness.

It may seem like I'm mincing words, but the distinction is important. Fulfillment expresses a lasting satisfaction with life - _knowing that we have lived according to our values and chased our dreams_.

When we picked our debt freedom goal 18 months ago, we didn't have an end-game. On the other side, we had dreams but no solid plan of how to achieve them.
