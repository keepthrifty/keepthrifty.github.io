We're just about a month away from closing on our house and finally downsizing from a 1900-square-foot home to a 1200-square-foot apartment. As excited as I've been, moving from home ownership to rental has felt like a bit of a step backwards.

My wife and I were looking at our finances in [Thrifty](/thrifty/) this week and made a startling observation. In the last 2 years, we've spent just shy of __$28,000__ on home maintenance and updates; that's 10% of the value of our home. While most of this spending was necessary (i.e. replacing our furnace when it died) or in the pursuit of finishing our house so we could sell but it still feels like an absurd amount of money. As we looked deeper into the numbers, we realized something unsettling. If we had decided to stay in our house, those numbers likely would have stayed the same or grown for years to come.



And that's when it hit us - for all the benefits we'd been looking at in selling our 1900-square-foot house to downsize to a 1200-sqaure-foot aparment, we'd missed one of the biggest.
