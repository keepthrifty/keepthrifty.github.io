___TK - NEED INTRO!!!___
Lots of posts about minimalism and simplicity; financial discipline - but we weren't always this way.

# A Simpler Time #

Jaime and I met in college; two early adults figuring out their place in the world and lucky enough to find someone to journey through life with.

Life back then seems so much simpler as I look at it now; It's not just because we didn't have kids and a mortgage and all the bills that come with full-on adulting.

It seems like things were simpler because we had found happiness with so much less than what we have today.

We had lived in fairly small spaces - dorm rooms and college apartments. A few hundred square feet seemed tight at times, but it never seemed to get in the way of our happiness.

We ate simple food - we'd make omelettes and frozen pizzas in our apartment kitchens.

Some of our best times together were spent in the cramped, minimally-furnished rooms of crappy apartments.

# Getting into the "Real World"

In 2007, we were both out of school and into the workforce. I'd been there a few years and was furiously saving up for a downpayment on a house while Jaime finished up school.

Once I hit the point that I knew I could make a 20% down payment on a "nice" house, we pulled the trigger and jumped into homeownership.

But when we went from a few hundred square feet to nearly 1800, our mindsets shifted. We began to let our space dictate our need for possessions instead of letting our priorities lead.

_Got a living room? You need a full furniture set_

_Got a great room too? You definitely need another set of couches and another TV_

_Four bedrooms for a married couple with no kids? Sounds like you need a couple home office setups_

Like most first-time-homebuyers, we quickly got to task on figuring out how to fill the space. To finance this endeavor, Jaime and I came up with our first attempt at assigned finances as a married couple - I'd take care of all the normal bills; she'd be responsible for furnishing the house.

Quickly, the house began to get filled with Pottery Barn tables, dressers, and couches. We decked out the house in the best we could buy and got to the point we could have easily hosted 




Before we

In 2014, we came to some stark realizations about the amount of clutter we had and the number of things we had purchased that weren't providing value in our lives.
