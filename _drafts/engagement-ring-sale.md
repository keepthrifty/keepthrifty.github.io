In 2006, I made the (at the time) largest purchase of my life - I put down $6,000 for a new, custom 1-carat diamond engagement ring at a fancy jewelry store.

_Last Saturday we sold her ring for $1,900._

Before you get worried, our marriage is great - better than ever. I am amazed at the number of times a week that we talk with each other about how blessed we feel with our current life and how excited we are about what we're working towards.

We're not in a bad financial situation either. We certainly don't _need_ the money for something; we've got a healthy emergency fund, good retirement savings, and are making prepayments on our mortgage.

# It's all about goals

Years ago, if you had asked us what our goals were, we would have said to have a family, a nice house, with nice stuff and live a safe, comfortable life.

I wouldn't say that there's anything wrong with this goal, but let's be honest - it's pretty bland. We worked toward this and by and large had it but it always seemed like something was missing.

Over the last few years, we've pushed ourselves to dream bigger. We've stretched to identify what our priorities are, continuously asking what's most important to us.

We've gone through a lot in the last few years and have reframed what our goals in life are

## Our family ##

_Maximizing the time we can spend together and the quality of that time_

## Our passions ##

_Ensuring time for us to pursue the things that we get true joy out of working on_

For me: this blog and coding the Thrifty tool

For my wife: simplifying and remodeling/upgrading our house

For us as a family: travel (we have a goal of visiting all 50 states in the USA with our kids before they graduate high school) and some fun family traditions we've built along the way

As our kids get older and their interests and passions become more clear, we'll be putting their passions right alongside ours to make sure they get focus as well.

## Our faith ##

_Living a life that reflects God's calling for us_

# Priorities make trade-offs clearer #

Something amazing happened once we got clarity on what our priorities are - we found tons of trade-offs that we could make to get closer to our goals.

When we identified our real priorities, it became easier drop our TV watching to 3 hours a week and re-invest the time we reclaimed in pursuing our passions and spending more time together.

The concept of dropping down to one car became a financial enabler of our dreams once we saw financial independence as a piece of our strategy to spend more time together.

Downsizing our home is the next big opportunity we're working toward; lower property taxes, electricity, insurance, and mortgage all get us closer to financial independence.

# Back to the ring #

My wife wears her wedding band nearly 24/7 but the engagement ring was usually sitting on a shelf since it was impractical when doing remodeling jobs around the house and too expensive to risk damaging.

In our house, it was the most expensive single item by a long shot and we had a coverage increase on our insurance to make sure we could replace the ring if it were ever stolen.

About a month ago, my wife told me that she thought she was ready to sell her ring. When I asked her what her reasoning was, she blew my mind.

> When you gave me that ring, it was our promise to marry each other. We fulfilled that promise years ago and I know we've got that for the rest of our life. I wear my wedding band as a symbol of where we're at now. If the money from selling the engagement ring can get us closer to our dream of spending more time together, I'll take that over having this ring any day of the week.

God, I love this woman. I was pretty sure I was ok with her idea of selling the ring before this, but when you put it that way? I married a minimalist badass who can see the path to her goals more clearly than just about anyone I've met.

# Where the money is going #

By selling the ring, we have more money to do the remodeling necessary to sell our house. When we sell our house, we'll downsize into something smaller and hopefully be able to purchase that house without a mortgage.

By having no mortgage and saving on electricity, property tax, insurance, and all the expenses that are proportional to the size of your house, our financial needs become much smaller.

With much smaller financial needs, we open up a world of flexibility that will allow us to spend more time together as a family.

# What's the lesson? #

_At a certain point, you decide what your real goals are and what changes are worth making to help you get there._

For us, the engagement ring was no longer a part of our goals. By selling the ring, we were able to instead use that money for something that is, pushing our life even further in the positive direction we've been headed.

# Other lessons #

I paid $6,000 for this ring in 2006 and sold it for just $1,900 in 2016. For those of you looking to buy (or receive) engagement rings in the future, I have a couple suggestions:

* Think about your long-term goals as a couple first - the important thing is the commitment itself, not the size or value of the ring. What goals could you achieve by agreeing to spend less on the engagement ring?
* Rings from a fancy store carry the same marketing/branding premium as clothes from a fancy store or furniture from a fancy store; I probably could have gotten the same ring elsewhere for significantly less

I don't regret buying this ring for my wife as it was a part of our journey to where we are today.  That said, I really happy with our decision to sell it and use that money for something that aligns with our current goals.

# What's your real dream?

If there's anything you take away from this, I hope you spend some time dreaming big - think about what you really want out of life. Then think about what you could give up today to get you closer to that goal.

Your goals are likely different from ours, but once you've got clarity on where you want to go, the pathways there will start to become very apparent.
