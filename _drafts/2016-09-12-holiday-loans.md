If you're already thinking about the holiday season and you're worried about how to pay for everything you need to have a joyous time, I ran across an article that proposed a solution for you.

One of my favorite features of my phone is that it frequently recommends articles or news stories that I might be interested in. Usually there's a good mix but the other day I got one that was a head-scratcher as to why Google's algorithms thought I'd appreciate it.

> The holiday season is fast approaching. You want to buy presents for friends and family. Maybe you’ll travel out of town. Secret Santa gifts, postage for holiday and even wrapping paper add up. If you haven’t saved enough, but don’t want to charge the seasonal expenses to your credit card, here’s a possible solution for you: a holiday loan.

> <cite>[GoBankingRates.com article](https://www.gobankingrates.com/personal-finance/tips-holiday-loan/)</cite>

The article goes on to explain not only the reason that a holiday loan is a "great" option but also the ways to get the best rate on one.

I was convinced that this had to be a joke.

How on earth can we possibly be in a state where this arrangement sounds reasonable to anyone?

# All the Times a Holiday Loan is Warranted #

Since this blog exists to share thoughts on personal finance and living an awesome life, I thought I'd chime in here with a full list of the times in which a holiday loan should be considered a valid option for you for the holidays:

1.

That's not a typo. There aren't any.

Seriously, I honestly can't think of one situation in which a holiday loan should be the right option for people to fund buying gifts for each other.

# If You Can Get Approved, You Shouldn't Need It #

One of the tips from the article is about checking your credit reports to make sure you get the best rate and to ensure that you improve your chances of getting approved.

Spend a minute thinking on that. In order to get a loan for the holidays, you need to demonstrate that you have the finances to pay it off.

You know what that says to me?

# What Were You Prioritizing Higher? #

If you're at this point in the year and unclear on whether you can afford gifts for the holidays, then you should view this as a reflection of what you've been prioritizing throughout the year. If holiday gifts are really that important to you, you should have been saving up.

Taking out a loan at this point is only going to make your life harder in the future. Put the interest cost into your monthly expenses and now you're in an even worse situation next year.

Don't let this be the start of a downward spiral for your finances.

# That's Not What The Holidays Are About #

Allow me to go on a brief rant-in-a-rant here about the commercialization of Christmas.

Christmas isn't about presents. It's not about decorations or cookies or lights on your house.

For Christians like me, Christmas is about the birth of Jesus - plain and simple.

{% assign tweet-text = "I'm pretty sure Jesus doesn't want you to go into more debt in the name of his birthday." %}

{% include tweet-link.html %}

I'm pretty sure he'd rather we focus on celebrating his birth and the gift he gave to us by coming into this world and dying to save us.

For non-christians, Christmas is commonly cited as being about family and togetherness.

Nowhere here did I see anything about buying crap that you and others probably don't actually need.

If it's about togetherness with family and friends, then just _be together with family and friends_.

That shouldn't be a several-thousand-dollar activity. Get on a bus, in a car, or invite people to you. Don't try to live up to some artificial expectations about spending a ton..

You're not a lesser son, daughter, husband, wife, father, or mother because of the number of presents you can or cannot buy for your friends and family.

If your focus is on loving one another, you'll do alright without all the unnecessary gifts.

# But What About the Kids? #

At this point the last outcry I can hear is from people who don't want their kids to have a horrible Christmas because if they can't buy presents, their kids won't get any.

{% assign tweet-text = "The flawed premise is that a child's well-being is determined by the presence or absence of toys" %}

{% include tweet-link.html %}

A child's well-being is determined by the presence or absence of _loving_ parents who attend to their _needs_.

Toys are not love. Your attention, your care, and your time are love.

But I'm not anti-toys. If you want to get your kids toys but feel like you can't afford them, here's an option instead of a holiday loan: go sell one of your TV's and buy some used games or toys off Craigslist.

You can easily get $50 for a TV and with that money get some gently-used toys and games. Beyond getting something for your kids that you can use to spend quality time with them, you'll get rid of one of the biggest time-sinks in your life at the same time.

The quality time you'll have as a family playing games together will be so much better for your kids and yourself than mindless time in front of the TV.

# Just Say No #

Don't do it. Don't put yourself in a worse situation for all the wrong reasons. Say no to holiday loans.

If you still feel like a holiday loan is the best option for you, shoot me an e-mail at [chris@keepthrifty.com](mailto:{{ page.author_email }}). Give me your reasons and I'd be happy to talk you off the ledge.

God bless and wishing you a happy holidays (when they finally arrive).
