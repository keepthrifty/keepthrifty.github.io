I have a shocking confession to make; I'm not really a fashion expert. That said, I'm starting to come around to the idea that I might be better off buying expensive clothes. What could possibly bring a fashion-averse engineer to a conclusion like that?

# The Useful Life of Clothes #

First a bit of a history lesson from _[True Wealth by Juliet Schor][plenitude-link]_:

> In the West, apparel has been expensive to produce and has therefore been a high-priced and valuable commodity for centuries. Once fashioned, garments had long and varied lives. A dress or jacket might be born as special occasion wear, then become a garment for indoor sociability, and eventually be worn (and worn out) while doing domestic chores... In some households, garments were turned into quilting squares... A piece of clothing might end its useful life as a rag, and literally turn to dust.

I don't know about you, but for me this was a:

Years ago, you'd buy the fanciest outfit you could get for a special occasion.

Over time, you'd start to wear the outfit for less formal situations, eventually leading to it serving as "everyday wear".

This would continue until the clothing was worn enough that it would be cut up into quilting squares or rags.

For those turned into rags, the rags would be used until the clothing disintegrated.

Not everyone may feel this way, but I see a beauty to the lack of waste here.

Here's the figure that's been floating in my head since reading _[True Wealth][plenitude-link]_ last year:

Native Americans (and many other cultures) make sure that when they kill an animal, they use every part - no waste. This feels much the same to me.

It shows a respect for what we've been blessed to have and helps ensure the continuity of the system.

# The Fashion Mentality #

Fast-forward to today and we've got a whole different mentality driving how people approach their clothing.

With the industrial revolution, cost to produce clothing went down significantly.

Along the way, clothing manufacturers realized that, to maximize their profitability, there was a need to create increased demand for clothing, so they harnessed something that previously was only available to the elite classes of society - fashion demand.

Clothing used to be something that was cherished and utilized to its full extent, only discarded early by those with excessive means.

By making "fashion" more accessible to the masses, clothing manufacturers were able to give people outside the upper echelon of society a sense of belonging and luxury by promoting new styles and obsoleting the old.

What this led to was a push to discard clothing __before__ it reached the end of its useful life, instead cycling out new clothing as it went "out of style".

## We Humans are Weird ##

Sometimes to put things we accept as "normal" in perspective, it is helpful to draw an extreme example of a parallel.

Pretend you went to the grocery store last week and bought 5 pounds of red apples. Apples are awesome - they keep for weeks and are great for your health; good job!

Now pretend that today, you saw a "food fashion" update on your favorite food fashion TV show that told you how all the celebrities and even your neighbors have stopped eating red apples because green apples are so in vogue.

![A happy green apple and a sad red apple][apple-faces]

<div class="image-caption">Red is sooooo last week.</div>

Being a good consumer food fashionista, you promptly throw away the remaining 4 pounds of good apples you have and go out and buy some green apples.

After all, you wouldn't want to be caught eating one of those when they're out of style, right?

This sounds crazy, right? I mean, c'mon - those were perfectly good apples, there was no reason to throw them out.

So why do we feel differently about clothes? What is it that makes us ditch the boot cut jeans for straight leg only to switch back 2 years later?

Or even better, what about the awesome, impractical, clothing styles that get adopted for just a year or so?

# Financial Aspects of Modern Clothing #

Regardless of what makes sense, we do live in a fashion-based world and we're all subject to it to at least some degree.

There's a twisted outcome from the push on the fast-fashion approach to clothing that's best understood by looking at it from the manufacturer's perspective.

Pretend I _know_ I'm going to turn the fashion over every season. At worst, if you're a good consumer, you keep your winter clothes for one, or maybe two years before replacing each outfit.

As a manufacturer, what's my incentive then to make clothes that can last longer than a year or two?

I can either spend $10 to make a t-shirt that will last 10 years or $2 to make a t-shirt that will last 2 years. I'm going to charge you $20 either way; which quality level do you think I'll choose?

How can I still charge you $20? Because you're not even going to _notice_ the quality difference unless you violate all the fashion rules and wear it longer than you're "supposed to".

Plus, I've got this cool brand name and logo and you saw that one a-list celebrity wear my clothes on a talk show. That's worth something, right?

Or maybe I'm sneakier and I make a $1 shirt and sell it to you for $5. You think you're getting a steal because hey, you spent more than that on lunch. In reality, I'm expecting you'll only wear it once or twice and then toss it for the next shiny one I put in front of you.

# Modern Useful Life of Clothes #

Based on all of this, here's how clothing is treated by most people today:

![Chart showing a bad clothing lifecycle: special occasion wear gets worn and then discarded; casual wear gets worn and then discarded; cleaning and painting clothes get worn and then discarded; rags are replaced by paper towels and then discarded][clothing-lifecycle-bad]

We no longer treat clothing as a valued item; we treat it as a disposable commodity.

We discard something that we paid for not because it has ceased to perform its function, but instead because it has ceased to meet the completely artificial definition of being "in style".

Going through this diagram helped me understand why I never had a desire to be "in fashion". It's not that I'm a nonconformist; it's that I simply think this kind of waste is stupid and completely unnecessary.

It's the same reason I cringe every time I see new ripped jeans for sale. Are we serious? We're going to take something that's fully functioning and __intentionally damage__ it, shortening its useful life?

How authentic is that?

My ripped jeans are because I spend a ton of time crawling around with my kids. That's authentic :)

Beyond all of this, we end up often seeing these clothes end up in the garbage, where the valuable materials inside the clothing are locked up in a landfill, difficult to reclaim and put back as nutrients to a new generation of plants.

# How to Bail Out #

If all of this is starting to sound like a really bad deal for you, then I did my job - it is.

So what can you do to avoid all this nonsense? Here are a few simple rules:

- Only buy to replace ___!!! TK !!!___
- Buy for quality  ___!!! TK !!!___ (30 year sweatshirt, patagonia, etc)
