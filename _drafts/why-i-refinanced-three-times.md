We bought our house almost right at the peak of the housing bubble in 2007. At the time, our mortgage terms were pretty amazing - 6.625% for a 30-year fixed mortgage was much better than the double-digit rates of the early 80's.

# Pathway to purchase #

We had been diligently saving toward a down payment and my hatred for wasteful spending had already been well established, so we were going for a full 20% to avoid PMI (private mortgage insurance).

We found a home that we knew we could make our own - an 1800 square foot tri-level in a nice suburb of Madison - and the sellers accepted our offer for $219,900.

# Mortgage 1 #

After closing costs and our down payment, we were finally committed to the biggest purchase of our lives and signed the papers for our mortgage in August of 2007.

The terms were pretty good - a $175,900 mortgage at a fixed 6.625% for 30 years. We avoided adjustable-rate mortgages because, well, I'll take certainty when I can get it.

Because I'd rather earn the interest on my escrow money (for property tax and homeowner's insurance) than let the bank take it, I negotiated keeping that out of the payment and letting us handle it on our own. It pays to ask these things :)

At this point, we had a manageable (but tight) monthly payment of $1126.31

# Mortgage 2 #

I don't know if you'd call it buyer's remorse, but I had a bad habit of keeping track of interest rates in the months after we bought our home.

I'd become so accustomed to checking [bankrate.com][bankrate] for the latest rates that I found myself looking a few times a week.

About 9 months in, I looked at the rates and saw that they had dropped below 6%. Seeing as how rates this low were relatively unprecedented, I did the math to see what the impact would be and was pleasantly surprised.

Even including the cost of refinancing (which we would roll back into the mortgage), we would save $18,000 over the term of the loan by refinancing. It's amazing what a little change in the interest rate can do.

We called up the bank, set up the refinancing at even more amazing terms.

Mortgage two was a $175,900 mortgage at a fixed 5.875% for 30 years with a monthly payment of $1040.51.

# Mortgage 3 #

We went along for a couple years making our regular payments and as our financial situation improved we started to talk about prepaying our mortgage so we could achieve a completely debt-free life.

At the same time, my wife was pregnant for the first time but apparently the pending birth of our first daughter wasn't enough to prevent us from taking advantage of another great deal.

Again a compulsive rate-checker, I had noticed rates plummeting as we got into 2010. Given that our goal was to get debt-free as soon as possible, I quickly latched on to the thought of a fixed 15-year mortgage.

Looking at the rates and where we stood, we could refi into a 15-year mortgage at 4.125% and end up with a payment that was only an extra $200 a month from what we were paying for the 30-year.

Chopping years off our debt-free date sold me, so we reached out to a new bank to get things going.

As we looked at the numbers, Jaime and I knew that we could now afford to pay down some of the mortgage in the process as well (we had been saving up), so we wrote an extra check for $10,000 and pulled the trigger.

Saving $120,000 over the life of the loan and getting done almost 13 years earlier? That was one of the easiest financial decisions I've ever made :)

Mortgage three was a $160,850 mortgage at a fixed 4.125% for 15 years with a monthly payment of $1199.89.

# Mortgage 4 #

You'd think at this point that I'd be satisfied; after all, how much better can it get?

Ever the optimizer, I couldn't stop checking rates and just about fell out of my chair they day I saw them drop below 3% for 15-year refinancing.

At this point, we knew we didn't need a lower payment, but just knowing the impact on interest payments was enough to make me crunch the numbers.

Once again, the math worked in our favor and we found ourselves calling our poor loan handler at the bank for another go-around.

We once again took the opportunity to pay our loan down a bit from our savings and re-financed $138,007.68 at a fixed 2.75% for 15 years with a monthly payment of $936.55.

## The beauty of prepayment ##

We could have just taken this and run, but the payoff date moving out was a bit of a step backwards for me. With that in mind, we decided to keep paying the $1200 payment we had previously, which meant we were prepaying an extra $263.65 each month directly to our principal.

That only lasted about 8 months - the financial reality of having 3 kids under 3 forces you to prioritize :)

That said, in that 8 months we paid down the mortgage another $2100.

# Where we stand today #

Through prepayments and sticking to our normal payment plan, we're excited that our mortgage is on-track to be under $100,000 early next year if we just keep making our normal payments.

That said, we have been seriously focusing on our financial discipline muscle over the last year and have gotten to the point where we feel like we can make some serious headway.

Our plan is to put an extra $1000 per month into prepaying our mortgage - something that will save us another $11,000 and knock 6.5 years off our payoff date.

And don't worry - we're not letting this get in the way of the other important stuff; we're still doing our annual roadtrip and other fun stuff.

I'd say we're now really seeing the financial impact of moving to a more minimalist lifestyle; we spend so much less now than we used to so we have the latitude to make a financial commitment to ourselves like this without breaking the bank.

# All together #

When you put all the changes we've made together since we first financed our house 9 years ago, the financial impact is staggering.

Including our down payment all the way through every payment and prepayment, we'll save ourselves over $160,000 and shaved off 16.4 years from our mortgage payoff timeline.

While refinancing takes research and work, I'd say it's been worth the time invested on my end!
