When we first bought our house in 2007, we committed to pay $450,000 total between down payment and our 30 years of mortgage payments. Given that the purchase price of our house was $220,000, I knew this was a huge opportunity for optimizing.

> For this article, I'll be looking at fixed mortgages (30 and 15-year) only. Adjustable or interest-only mortgages are a whole different beast that are best avoided (in my opinion) :)

# How does $220,000 turn into $450,000? #

For our home purchase, we paid down 20%, leaving us with a $175,900 mortgage. At 6.625% for a 30-year fixed mortgage, the total interest paid is $229,570. That's right - the total interest is _more_ than the actual purchase price of the house.

Such is the nature of buying things you don't have the money for.

> A side note: this is at 6.625% which was some of the best rates seen in the US. In the 80's, rates climbed into the ___teens___. If my mortgage had been at 14%, the total interest would have been $575,000!

## Total cost: $449,450 ##

Here's the breakdown of how we get to $449,450:

- Down Payment: $43,980
- Mortgage: $405,470
  - Principal payments: $175,900
  - Interest payments: $229,570

The only flexible piece here is the interest payments. The down payment and principal payments cover the purchase price; the interest is the price I pay for the right to buy my home before I can pay for the whole thing.

# Methods to drop your total cost #

Based on this, there are really only a couple ways to drop your total mortgage cost - getting a lower rate, making additional principal payments, or a shorter loan. Here's how each works:

## Refinancing with a lower rate ##

Refinancing is working with a bank to "re-do" your mortgage. If interest rates have dropped this can significantly reduce your total interest payments as a lower rate means less interest payment every month.

That said, re-doing your mortgage doesn't just reset your rate, it also resets your payment calendar. That is, if you are 10 years into a 30 year mortgage when you re-finance you reset the clock and have another 30 years of mortgage payments ahead of you.

One other caveat here is that refinancing isn't free - you have to pay fees to get a new loan and this can be hundreds or thousands of dollars.

In general, our philosophy has been that refinancing makes sense if there's a significant enough drop in the interest rate. To offset the calendar reset, we then look at applying prepayments:

## Making additional principal payments (prepaying) ##



## Refinancing with a shorter loan ##

# Our moves #

# Pathway to purchase #

We had been diligently saving toward a down payment and my hatred for wasteful spending had already been well established, so we were going for a full 20% to avoid PMI (private mortgage insurance).

We found a home that we knew we could make our own - an 1800 square foot tri-level in a nice suburb of Madison - and the sellers accepted our offer for $219,900.

# Mortgage 1 #

After closing costs and our down payment, we were finally committed to the biggest purchase of our lives and signed the papers for our mortgage in August of 2007.

The terms were pretty good - a $175,900 mortgage at a fixed 6.625% for 30 years. We avoided adjustable-rate mortgages because, well, I'll take certainty when I can get it.

Because I'd rather earn the interest on my escrow money (for property tax and homeowner's insurance) than let the bank take it, I negotiated keeping that out of the payment and letting us handle it on our own. It pays to ask these things :)

At this point, we had a manageable (but tight) monthly payment of $1126.31

# Mortgage 2 #

I don't know if you'd call it buyer's remorse, but I had a bad habit of keeping track of interest rates in the months after we bought our home.

I'd become so accustomed to checking [bankrate.com][bankrate] for the latest rates that I found myself looking a few times a week.

About 9 months in, I looked at the rates and saw that they had dropped below 6%. Seeing as how rates this low were relatively unprecedented, I did the math to see what the impact would be and was pleasantly surprised.

Even including the cost of refinancing (which we would roll back into the mortgage), we would save $18,000 over the term of the loan by refinancing. It's amazing what a little change in the interest rate can do.

We called up the bank, set up the refinancing at even more amazing terms.

Mortgage two was a $175,900 mortgage at a fixed 5.875% for 30 years with a monthly payment of $1040.51.

# Mortgage 3 #

We went along for a couple years making our regular payments and as our financial situation improved we started to talk about prepaying our mortgage so we could achieve a completely debt-free life.

At the same time, my wife was pregnant for the first time but apparently the pending birth of our first daughter wasn't enough to prevent us from taking advantage of another great deal.

Again a compulsive rate-checker, I had noticed rates plummeting as we got into 2010. Given that our goal was to get debt-free as soon as possible, I quickly latched on to the thought of a fixed 15-year mortgage.

Looking at the rates and where we stood, we could refi into a 15-year mortgage at 4.125% and end up with a payment that was only an extra $200 a month from what we were paying for the 30-year.

Chopping years off our debt-free date sold me, so we reached out to a new bank to get things going.

As we looked at the numbers, Jaime and I knew that we could now afford to pay down some of the mortgage in the process as well (we had been saving up), so we wrote an extra check for $10,000 and pulled the trigger.

Saving $120,000 over the life of the loan and getting done almost 13 years earlier? That was one of the easiest financial decisions I've ever made :)

Mortgage three was a $160,850 mortgage at a fixed 4.125% for 15 years with a monthly payment of $1199.89.

# Mortgage 4 #

You'd think at this point that I'd be satisfied; after all, how much better can it get?

Ever the optimizer, I couldn't stop checking rates and just about fell out of my chair they day I saw them drop below 3% for 15-year refinancing.

At this point, we knew we didn't need a lower payment, but just knowing the impact on interest payments was enough to make me crunch the numbers.

Once again, the math worked in our favor and we found ourselves calling our poor loan handler at the bank for another go-around.

We once again took the opportunity to pay our loan down a bit from our savings and re-financed $138,007.68 at a fixed 2.75% for 15 years with a monthly payment of $936.55.

## The beauty of prepayment ##

We could have just taken this and run, but the payoff date moving out was a bit of a step backwards for me. With that in mind, we decided to keep paying the $1200 payment we had previously, which meant we were prepaying an extra $263.65 each month directly to our principal.

That only lasted about 8 months - the financial reality of having 3 kids under 3 forces you to prioritize :)

That said, in that 8 months we paid down the mortgage another $2100.

# Where we stand today #

Through prepayments and sticking to our normal payment plan, we're excited that our mortgage is on-track to be under $100,000 early next year if we just keep making our normal payments.

That said, we have been seriously focusing on our financial discipline muscle over the last year and have gotten to the point where we feel like we can make some serious headway.

Our plan is to put an extra $1000 per month into prepaying our mortgage - something that will save us another $11,000 and knock 6.5 years off our payoff date.

And don't worry - we're not letting this get in the way of the other important stuff; we're still doing our annual roadtrip and other fun stuff.

I'd say we're now really seeing the financial impact of moving to a more minimalist lifestyle; we spend so much less now than we used to so we have the latitude to make a financial commitment to ourselves like this without breaking the bank.

# All together #

When you put all the changes we've made together since we first financed our house 9 years ago, the financial impact is staggering.

Including our down payment all the way through every payment and prepayment, we'll save ourselves over $160,000 and shaved off 16.4 years from our mortgage payoff timeline.

While refinancing takes research and work, I'd say it's been worth the time invested on my end!
