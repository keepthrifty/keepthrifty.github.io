Personal finance is a combination of common sense, inspired goal-chasing, and mathematical discipline. Here are some tools you can use to help you with that last part - figuring out the numbers so you can make informed decisions.

## Cost to Retire Earlier ##

I wrote a post that introduced two calculators to understand both [how much it costs to buy an extra day of retirement]({% post_url 2016-09-18-the-price-of-an-extra-day %}) and [how many extra days of retirement you can buy]({% post_url 2016-09-18-the-price-of-an-extra-day %}). These were inspired by the question of "How many days of retirement did I earn from going to work today?". Plug in your own numbers and check them out!
